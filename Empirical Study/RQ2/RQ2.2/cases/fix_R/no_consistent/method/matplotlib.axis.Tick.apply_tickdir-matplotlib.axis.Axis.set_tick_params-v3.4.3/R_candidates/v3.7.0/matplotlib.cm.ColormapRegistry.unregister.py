    def unregister(self, name):
        """
        Remove a colormap from the registry.

        You cannot remove built-in colormaps.

        If the named colormap is not registered, returns with no error, raises
        if you try to de-register a default colormap.

        .. warning::

            Colormap names are currently a shared namespace that may be used
            by multiple packages. Use `unregister` only if you know you
            have registered that name before. In particular, do not
            unregister just in case to clean the name before registering a
            new colormap.

        Parameters
        ----------
        name : str
            The name of the colormap to be removed.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If you try to remove a default built-in colormap.
