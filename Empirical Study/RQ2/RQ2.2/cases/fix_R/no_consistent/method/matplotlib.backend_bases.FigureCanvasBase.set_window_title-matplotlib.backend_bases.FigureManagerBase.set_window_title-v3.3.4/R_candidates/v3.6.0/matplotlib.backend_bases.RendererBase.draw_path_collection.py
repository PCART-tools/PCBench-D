        Draw a collection of *paths*.

        Each path is first transformed by the corresponding entry
        in *all_transforms* (a list of (3, 3) matrices) and then by
        *master_transform*.  They are then translated by the corresponding
        entry in *offsets*, which has been first transformed by *offset_trans*.

        *facecolors*, *edgecolors*, *linewidths*, *linestyles*, and
        *antialiased* are lists that set the corresponding properties.

        *offset_position* is unused now, but the argument is kept for
        backwards compatibility.

        The base (fallback) implementation makes multiple calls to `draw_path`.
        Backends may want to override this in order to render each set of
        path data only once, and then reference that path multiple times with
        the different offsets, colors, styles etc.  The generator methods
        `_iter_collection_raw_paths` and `_iter_collection` are provided to
        help with (and standardize) the implementation across backends.  It
        is highly recommended to use those generators, so that changes to the
        behavior of `draw_path_collection` can be made globally.
