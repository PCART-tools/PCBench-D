    Used by the ForeignKey field to store information about the relation.

    ``_meta.get_fields()`` returns this class to provide access to the field
    flags for the reverse relation.

    Note: Because we somewhat abuse the Rel objects by using them as reverse
    fields we get the funny situation where
    ``ManyToOneRel.many_to_one == False`` and
    ``ManyToOneRel.one_to_many == True``. This is unfortunate but the actual
    ManyToOneRel class is a private API and there is work underway to turn
    reverse relations into actual fields.
