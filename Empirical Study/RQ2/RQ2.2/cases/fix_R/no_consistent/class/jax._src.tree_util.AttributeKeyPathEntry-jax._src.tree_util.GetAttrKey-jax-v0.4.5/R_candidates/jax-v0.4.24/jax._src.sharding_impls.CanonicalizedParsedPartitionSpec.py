class CanonicalizedParsedPartitionSpec(ParsedPartitionSpec):
  """ParsedPartitionSpecs that are canonicalized.

  ParsedPartitionSpecs may contain trailing empty tuples, that make them
  semantically different in general, and yet in some situations we prefer
  to regard them as equivalent. For example, partitions of () and ((),)
  cannot be always considered equivalent, since the first one is a valid
  spec for a scalar value, while the second is not! However, when either of
  those are applied to a 2D array, they both mean that the array is fully
  replicated.

  So CanonicalizedParsedPartitionSpecs removes the trailing empty tuples from
  partitions.
