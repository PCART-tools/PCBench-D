def clique_removal(G):
    r"""Repeatedly remove cliques from the graph.

    Results in a $O(|V|/(\log |V|)^2)$ approximation of maximum clique
    and independent set. Returns the largest independent set found, along
    with found maximal cliques.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        Undirected graph

    Returns
    -------
    max_ind_cliques : (set, list) tuple
        2-tuple of Maximal Independent Set and list of maximal cliques (sets).

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXNotImplemented
        If the graph is directed or is a multigraph.
