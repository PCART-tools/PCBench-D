def _bidirectional_shortest_path(G, source, target, exclude):
    """Returns shortest path between source and target ignoring nodes in the
    container 'exclude'.

    Parameters
    ----------

    G : NetworkX graph

    source : node
        Starting node for path

    target : node
        Ending node for path

    exclude: container
        Container for nodes to exclude from the search for shortest paths

    Returns
    -------
    path: list
        Shortest path between source and target ignoring nodes in 'exclude'

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXNoPath
        If there is no path or if nodes are adjacent and have only one path
        between them

    Notes
    -----
    This function and its helper are originally from
    networkx.algorithms.shortest_paths.unweighted and are modified to
    accept the extra parameter 'exclude', which is a container for nodes
    already used in other paths that should be ignored.
