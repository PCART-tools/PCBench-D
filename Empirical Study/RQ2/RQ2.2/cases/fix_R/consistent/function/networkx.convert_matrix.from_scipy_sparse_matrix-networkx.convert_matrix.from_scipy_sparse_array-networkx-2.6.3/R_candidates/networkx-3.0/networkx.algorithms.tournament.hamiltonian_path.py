def hamiltonian_path(G):
    """Returns a Hamiltonian path in the given tournament graph.

    Each tournament has a Hamiltonian path. If furthermore, the
    tournament is strongly connected, then the returned Hamiltonian path
    is a Hamiltonian cycle (by joining the endpoints of the path).

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        A directed graph representing a tournament.

    Returns
    -------
    path : list
        A list of nodes which form a Hamiltonian path in `G`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from networkx.algorithms import tournament
    >>> G = nx.DiGraph([(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)])
    >>> tournament.hamiltonian_path(G)
    [0, 1, 2, 3]

    Notes
    -----
    This is a recursive implementation with an asymptotic running time
    of $O(n^2)$, ignoring multiplicative polylogarithmic factors, where
    $n$ is the number of nodes in the graph.
