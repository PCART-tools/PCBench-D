def _bfs_with_marks(G, start_node, check_set):
    """Breadth-first-search with markings.

    Performs BFS starting from ``start_node`` and whenever a node
    inside ``check_set`` is met, it is "marked". Once a node is marked,
    BFS does not continue along that path. The resulting marked nodes
    are returned.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : nx.Graph
        An undirected graph.
    start_node : node
        The start of the BFS.
    check_set : set
        The set of nodes to check against.

    Returns
    -------
    marked : set
        A set of nodes that were marked.
