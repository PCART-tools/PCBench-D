def panther_similarity(G, source, k=5, path_length=5, c=0.5, delta=0.1, eps=None):
    r"""Returns the Panther similarity of nodes in the graph `G` to node ``v``.

    Panther is a similarity metric that says "two objects are considered
    to be similar if they frequently appear on the same paths." [1]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        A NetworkX graph
    source : node
        Source node for which to find the top `k` similar other nodes
    k : int (default = 5)
        The number of most similar nodes to return
    path_length : int (default = 5)
        How long the randomly generated paths should be (``T`` in [1]_)
    c : float (default = 0.5)
        A universal positive constant used to scale the number
        of sample random paths to generate.
    delta : float (default = 0.1)
        The probability that the similarity $S$ is not an epsilon-approximation to (R, phi),
        where $R$ is the number of random paths and $\phi$ is the probability
        that an element sampled from a set $A \subseteq D$, where $D$ is the domain.
    eps : float or None (default = None)
        The error bound. Per [1]_, a good value is ``sqrt(1/|E|)``. Therefore,
        if no value is provided, the recommended computed value will be used.

    Returns
    -------
    similarity : dictionary
        Dictionary of nodes to similarity scores (as floats). Note:
        the self-similarity (i.e., ``v``) will not be included in
        the returned dictionary.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.star_graph(10)
    >>> sim = nx.panther_similarity(G, 0)
