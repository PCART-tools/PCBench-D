def onion_layers(G):
    """Returns the layer of each vertex in an onion decomposition of the graph.

    The onion decomposition refines the k-core decomposition by providing
    information on the internal organization of each k-shell. It is usually
    used alongside the `core numbers`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        A simple graph without self loops or parallel edges

    Returns
    -------
    od_layers : dictionary
        A dictionary keyed by vertex to the onion layer. The layers are
        contiguous integers starting at 1.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        The onion decomposition is not implemented for graphs with self loops
        or parallel edges or for directed graphs.

    Notes
    -----
    Not implemented for graphs with parallel edges or self loops.

    Not implemented for directed graphs.
