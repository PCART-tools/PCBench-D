def cartesian_product(G, H):
    r"""Returns the Cartesian product of G and H.

    The Cartesian product $P$ of the graphs $G$ and $H$ has a node set that
    is the Cartesian product of the node sets, $V(P)=V(G) \times V(H)$.
    $P$ has an edge $((u,v),(x,y))$ if and only if either $u$ is equal to $x$
    and both $v$ and $y$ are adjacent in $H$ or if $v$ is equal to $y$ and
    both $u$ and $x$ are adjacent in $G$.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G, H: graphs
     Networkx graphs.

    Returns
    -------
    P: NetworkX graph
     The Cartesian product of G and H. P will be a multi-graph if either G
     or H is a multi-graph. Will be a directed if G and H are directed,
     and undirected if G and H are undirected.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
     If G and H are not both directed or both undirected.

    Notes
    -----
    Node attributes in P are two-tuple of the G and H node attributes.
    Missing attributes are assigned None.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.Graph()
    >>> H = nx.Graph()
    >>> G.add_node(0, a1=True)
    >>> H.add_node("a", a2="Spam")
    >>> P = nx.cartesian_product(G, H)
    >>> list(P)
    [(0, 'a')]

    Edge attributes and edge keys (for multigraphs) are also copied to the
    new product graph
