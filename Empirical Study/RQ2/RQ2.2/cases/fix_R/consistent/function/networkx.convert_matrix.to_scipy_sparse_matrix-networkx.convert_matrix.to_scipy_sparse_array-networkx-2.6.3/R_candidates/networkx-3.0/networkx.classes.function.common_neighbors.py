    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
        A NetworkX undirected graph.

    u, v : nodes
        Nodes in the graph.

    Returns
    -------
    cnbors : iterator
        Iterator of common neighbors of u and v in the graph.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        If u or v is not a node in the graph.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.complete_graph(5)
    >>> sorted(nx.common_neighbors(G, 0, 1))
    [2, 3, 4]
