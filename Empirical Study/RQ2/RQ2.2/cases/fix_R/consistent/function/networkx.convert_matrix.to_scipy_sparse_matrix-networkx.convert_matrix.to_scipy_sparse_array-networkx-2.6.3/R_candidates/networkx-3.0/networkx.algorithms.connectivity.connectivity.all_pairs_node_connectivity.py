def all_pairs_node_connectivity(G, nbunch=None, flow_func=None):
    """Compute node connectivity between all pairs of nodes of G.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        Undirected graph

    nbunch: container
        Container of nodes. If provided node connectivity will be computed
        only over pairs of nodes in nbunch.

    flow_func : function
        A function for computing the maximum flow among a pair of nodes.
        The function has to accept at least three parameters: a Digraph,
        a source node, and a target node. And return a residual network
        that follows NetworkX conventions (see :meth:`maximum_flow` for
        details). If flow_func is None, the default maximum flow function
        (:meth:`edmonds_karp`) is used. See below for details. The
        choice of the default function may change from version
        to version and should not be relied on. Default value: None.

    Returns
    -------
    all_pairs : dict
        A dictionary with node connectivity between all pairs of nodes
        in G, or in nbunch if provided.
