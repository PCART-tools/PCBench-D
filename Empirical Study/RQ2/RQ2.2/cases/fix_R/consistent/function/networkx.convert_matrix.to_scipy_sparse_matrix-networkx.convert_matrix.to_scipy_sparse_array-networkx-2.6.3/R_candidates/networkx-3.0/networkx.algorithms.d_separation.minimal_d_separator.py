def minimal_d_separator(G, u, v):
    """Compute a minimal d-separating set between 'u' and 'v'.

    A d-separating set in a DAG is a set of nodes that blocks all paths
    between the two nodes, 'u' and 'v'. This function
    constructs a d-separating set that is "minimal", meaning it is the smallest
    d-separating set for 'u' and 'v'. This is not necessarily
    unique. For more details, see Notes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
        A networkx DAG.
    u : node
        A node in the graph, G.
    v : node
        A node in the graph, G.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        Raises a :exc:`NetworkXError` if the input graph is not a DAG.

    NodeNotFound
        If any of the input nodes are not found in the graph,
        a :exc:`NodeNotFound` exception is raised.

    Notes
    -----
    This function only finds ``a`` minimal d-separator. It does not guarantee
    uniqueness, since in a DAG there may be more than one minimal d-separator
    between two nodes. Moreover, this only checks for minimal separators
    between two nodes, not two sets. Finding minimal d-separators between
    two sets of nodes is not supported.

    Uses the algorithm presented in [1]_. The complexity of the algorithm
    is :math:`O(|E_{An}^m|)`, where :math:`|E_{An}^m|` stands for the
    number of edges in the moralized graph of the sub-graph consisting
    of only the ancestors of 'u' and 'v'. For full details, see [1]_.

    The algorithm works by constructing the moral graph consisting of just
    the ancestors of `u` and `v`. Then it constructs a candidate for
    a separating set  ``Z'`` from the predecessors of `u` and `v`.
    Then BFS is run starting from `u` and marking nodes
    found from ``Z'`` and calling those nodes ``Z''``.
    Then BFS is run again starting from `v` and marking nodes if they are
    present in ``Z''``. Those marked nodes are the returned minimal
    d-separating set.
