def degree_centrality(G, nodes):
    r"""Compute the degree centrality for nodes in a bipartite network.

    The degree centrality for a node `v` is the fraction of nodes
    connected to it.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
       A bipartite network

    nodes : list or container
      Container with all nodes in one bipartite node set.

    Returns
    -------
    centrality : dictionary
       Dictionary keyed by node with bipartite degree centrality as the value.

    :func:`~networkx.algorithms.bipartite.basic.is_bipartite`

    Notes
    -----
    The nodes input parameter must contain all nodes in one bipartite node set,
    but the dictionary returned contains all nodes from both bipartite node
    sets. See :mod:`bipartite documentation <networkx.algorithms.bipartite>`
    for further details on how bipartite graphs are handled in NetworkX.

    For unipartite networks, the degree centrality values are
    normalized by dividing by the maximum possible degree (which is
    `n-1` where `n` is the number of nodes in G).

    In the bipartite case, the maximum possible degree of a node in a
    bipartite node set is the number of nodes in the opposite node set
    [1]_.  The degree centrality for a node `v` in the bipartite
    sets `U` with `n` nodes and `V` with `m` nodes is

    .. math::

        d_{v} = \frac{deg(v)}{m}, \mbox{for} v \in U ,

        d_{v} = \frac{deg(v)}{n}, \mbox{for} v \in V ,


    where `deg(v)` is the degree of node `v`.
