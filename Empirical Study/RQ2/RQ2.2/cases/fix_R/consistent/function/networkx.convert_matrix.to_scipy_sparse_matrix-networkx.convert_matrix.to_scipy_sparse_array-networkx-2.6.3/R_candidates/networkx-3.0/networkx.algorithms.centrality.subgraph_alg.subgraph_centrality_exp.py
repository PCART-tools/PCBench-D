def subgraph_centrality_exp(G):
    r"""Returns the subgraph centrality for each node of G.

    Subgraph centrality  of a node `n` is the sum of weighted closed
    walks of all lengths starting and ending at node `n`. The weights
    decrease with path length. Each closed walk is associated with a
    connected subgraph ([1]_).

    Parameters
    ----------
    G: graph

    Returns
    -------
    nodes:dictionary
        Dictionary of nodes with subgraph centrality as the value.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        If the graph is not undirected and simple.

    See Also
    --------
    subgraph_centrality:
        Alternative algorithm of the subgraph centrality for each node of G.

    Notes
    -----
    This version of the algorithm exponentiates the adjacency matrix.

    The subgraph centrality of a node `u` in G can be found using
    the matrix exponential of the adjacency matrix of G [1]_,

    .. math::

        SC(u)=(e^A)_{uu} .
