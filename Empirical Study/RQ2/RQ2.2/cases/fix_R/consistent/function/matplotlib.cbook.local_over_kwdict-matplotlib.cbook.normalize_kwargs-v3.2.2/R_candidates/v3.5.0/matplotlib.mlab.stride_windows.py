def stride_windows(x, n, noverlap=None, axis=0):
    """
    Get all windows of x with length n as a single array,
    using strides to avoid data duplication.

    .. warning::

        It is not safe to write to the output array.  Multiple
        elements may point to the same piece of memory,
        so modifying one value may change others.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : 1D array or sequence
        Array or sequence containing the data.
    n : int
        The number of data points in each window.
    noverlap : int, default: 0 (no overlap)
        The overlap between adjacent windows.
    axis : int
        The axis along which the windows will run.
