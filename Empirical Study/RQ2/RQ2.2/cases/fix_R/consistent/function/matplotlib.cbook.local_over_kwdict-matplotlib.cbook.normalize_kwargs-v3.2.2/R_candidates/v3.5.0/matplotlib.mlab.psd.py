    r"""
    Compute the power spectral density.

    The power spectral density :math:`P_{xx}` by Welch's average
    periodogram method.  The vector *x* is divided into *NFFT* length
    segments.  Each segment is detrended by function *detrend* and
    windowed by function *window*.  *noverlap* gives the length of
    the overlap between segments.  The :math:`|\mathrm{fft}(i)|^2`
    of each segment :math:`i` are averaged to compute :math:`P_{xx}`.

    If len(*x*) < *NFFT*, it will be zero padded to *NFFT*.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : 1-D array or sequence
        Array or sequence containing the data

    %(Spectral)s

    %(PSD)s

    noverlap : int, default: 0 (no overlap)
        The number of points of overlap between segments.

    Returns
    -------
    Pxx : 1-D array
        The values for the power spectrum :math:`P_{xx}` (real valued)

    freqs : 1-D array
        The frequencies corresponding to the elements in *Pxx*

    specgram
        `specgram` differs in the default overlap; in not returning the mean of
        the segment periodograms; and in returning the times of the segments.

    magnitude_spectrum : returns the magnitude spectrum.

    csd : returns the spectral density between two signals.
