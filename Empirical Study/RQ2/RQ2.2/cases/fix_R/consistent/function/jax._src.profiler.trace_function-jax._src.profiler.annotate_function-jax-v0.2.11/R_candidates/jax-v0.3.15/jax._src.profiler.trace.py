  The trace will capture CPU, GPU, and/or TPU activity, including Python
  functions and JAX on-device operations.

  The resulting trace can be viewed with TensorBoard. Note that TensorBoard
  doesn't need to be running when collecting the trace.

  Only once trace may be collected a time. A RuntimeError will be raised if a
  trace is started while another trace is running.

    log_dir: The directory to save the profiler trace to (usually the
      TensorBoard log directory).
    create_perfetto_link: A boolean which, if true, creates and prints link to
      the Perfetto trace viewer UI (https://ui.perfetto.dev). The program will
      block until the link is opened and Perfetto loads the trace.
