  """A for-loop combinator that allows read/write semantics in the loop body.

  `for_loop` is a higher-order function that enables writing loops that can be
  staged out in JIT-ted JAX computations. Unlike `jax.lax.fori_loop`, it allows
  mutation in its body using `Ref`s.

  `for_loop` will initialize `Ref`s with the values in `init_state`. Each
  iteration, `body` will be called with the current `Ref`s, which can be read
  from and written to using `ref_get` and `ref_set`.

  `for_loop` is semantically equivalent to the following Python code:

  ```python
  def for_loop(nsteps, body, init_state):
    refs = tree_map(make_ref, init_state)
    for i in range(nsteps):
      body(i, refs)
    return tree_map(ref_get, refs)
  ```

  Args:
    nsteps: Number of iterations
    body: A callable that takes in the iteration number as its first argument
      and `Ref`s corresponding to `init_state` as its second argument.
      `body` is free to read from and write to its `Ref`s. `body` should
       not return anything.
    init_state: A Pytree of JAX-compatible values used to initialize the `Ref`s
      that will be passed into the for loop body.
  Returns:
    A Pytree of values representing the output of the for loop.
