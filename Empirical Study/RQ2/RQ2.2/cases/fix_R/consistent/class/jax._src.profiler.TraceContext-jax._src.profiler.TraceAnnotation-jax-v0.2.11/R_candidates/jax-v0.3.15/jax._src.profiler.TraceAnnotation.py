  """Context manager that generates a trace event in the profiler.

  The trace event spans the duration of the code enclosed by the context.

  For example:

  >>> x = jnp.ones((1000, 1000))
  >>> with jax.profiler.TraceAnnotation("my_label"):
  ...   result = jnp.dot(x, x.T).block_until_ready()

  This will cause a "my_label" event to show up on the trace timeline if the
  event occurs while the process is being traced.
