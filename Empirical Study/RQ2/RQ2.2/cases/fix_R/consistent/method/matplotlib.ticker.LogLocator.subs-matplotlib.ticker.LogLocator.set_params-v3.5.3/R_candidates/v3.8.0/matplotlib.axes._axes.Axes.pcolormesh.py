        *X* and *Y* can be used to specify the corners of the quadrilaterals.

        .. hint::

           `~.Axes.pcolormesh` is similar to `~.Axes.pcolor`. It is much faster
           and preferred in most cases. For a detailed discussion on the
           differences see :ref:`Differences between pcolor() and pcolormesh()
           <differences-pcolor-pcolormesh>`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        C : array-like
            The mesh data. Supported array shapes are:

            - (M, N) or M*N: a mesh with scalar data. The values are mapped to
              colors using normalization and a colormap. See parameters *norm*,
              *cmap*, *vmin*, *vmax*.
            - (M, N, 3): an image with RGB values (0-1 float or 0-255 int).
            - (M, N, 4): an image with RGBA values (0-1 float or 0-255 int),
              i.e. including transparency.

            The first two dimensions (M, N) define the rows and columns of
            the mesh data.

        X, Y : array-like, optional
            The coordinates of the corners of quadrilaterals of a pcolormesh::

                (X[i+1, j], Y[i+1, j])       (X[i+1, j+1], Y[i+1, j+1])
                                      ●╶───╴●
                                      │     │
                                      ●╶───╴●
                    (X[i, j], Y[i, j])       (X[i, j+1], Y[i, j+1])

            Note that the column index corresponds to the x-coordinate, and
            the row index corresponds to y. For details, see the
            :ref:`Notes <axes-pcolormesh-grid-orientation>` section below.

            If ``shading='flat'`` the dimensions of *X* and *Y* should be one
            greater than those of *C*, and the quadrilateral is colored due
            to the value at ``C[i, j]``.  If *X*, *Y* and *C* have equal
            dimensions, a warning will be raised and the last row and column
            of *C* will be ignored.

            If ``shading='nearest'`` or ``'gouraud'``, the dimensions of *X*
            and *Y* should be the same as those of *C* (if not, a ValueError
            will be raised).  For ``'nearest'`` the color ``C[i, j]`` is
            centered on ``(X[i, j], Y[i, j])``.  For ``'gouraud'``, a smooth
            interpolation is caried out between the quadrilateral corners.

            If *X* and/or *Y* are 1-D arrays or column vectors they will be
            expanded as needed into the appropriate 2D arrays, making a
            rectangular grid.

        %(vmin_vmax_doc)s

        edgecolors : {'none', None, 'face', color, color sequence}, optional
            The color of the edges. Defaults to 'none'. Possible values:

            - 'none' or '': No edge.
            - *None*: :rc:`patch.edgecolor` will be used. Note that currently
              :rc:`patch.force_edgecolor` has to be True for this to work.
            - 'face': Use the adjacent face color.
            - A color or sequence of colors will set the edge color.

            The singular form *edgecolor* works as an alias.

        alpha : float, default: None
            The alpha blending value, between 0 (transparent) and 1 (opaque).

        shading : {'flat', 'nearest', 'gouraud', 'auto'}, optional
            The fill style for the quadrilateral; defaults to
            :rc:`pcolor.shading`. Possible values:

            - 'flat': A solid color is used for each quad. The color of the
              quad (i, j), (i+1, j), (i, j+1), (i+1, j+1) is given by
              ``C[i, j]``. The dimensions of *X* and *Y* should be
              one greater than those of *C*; if they are the same as *C*,
              then a deprecation warning is raised, and the last row
              and column of *C* are dropped.
            - 'nearest': Each grid point will have a color centered on it,
              extending halfway between the adjacent grid centers.  The
              dimensions of *X* and *Y* must be the same as *C*.
            - 'gouraud': Each quad will be Gouraud shaded: The color of the
              corners (i', j') are given by ``C[i', j']``. The color values of
              the area in between is interpolated from the corner values.
              The dimensions of *X* and *Y* must be the same as *C*. When
              Gouraud shading is used, *edgecolors* is ignored.
            - 'auto': Choose 'flat' if dimensions of *X* and *Y* are one
              larger than *C*.  Choose 'nearest' if dimensions are the same.

            See :doc:`/gallery/images_contours_and_fields/pcolormesh_grids`
            for more description.

        snap : bool, default: False
            Whether to snap the mesh to pixel boundaries.

        rasterized : bool, optional
            Rasterize the pcolormesh when drawing vector graphics.  This can
            speed up rendering and produce smaller files for large data sets.
            See also :doc:`/gallery/misc/rasterization_demo`.

        Notes
        -----
        **Masked arrays**

        *C* may be a masked array. If ``C[i, j]`` is masked, the corresponding
        quadrilateral will be transparent. Masking of *X* and *Y* is not
        supported. Use `~.Axes.pcolor` if you need this functionality.

        .. _axes-pcolormesh-grid-orientation:

        **Grid orientation**

        The grid orientation follows the standard matrix convention: An array
        *C* with shape (nrows, ncolumns) is plotted with the column number as
        *X* and the row number as *Y*.

        .. _differences-pcolor-pcolormesh:

        **Differences between pcolor() and pcolormesh()**

        Both methods are used to create a pseudocolor plot of a 2D array
        using quadrilaterals.

        The main difference lies in the created object and internal data
        handling:
        While `~.Axes.pcolor` returns a `.PolyQuadMesh`, `~.Axes.pcolormesh`
        returns a `.QuadMesh`. The latter is more specialized for the given
        purpose and thus is faster. It should almost always be preferred.

        There is also a slight difference in the handling of masked arrays.
        Both `~.Axes.pcolor` and `~.Axes.pcolormesh` support masked arrays
        for *C*. However, only `~.Axes.pcolor` supports masked arrays for *X*
        and *Y*. The reason lies in the internal handling of the masked values.
        `~.Axes.pcolor` leaves out the respective polygons from the
        PolyQuadMesh. `~.Axes.pcolormesh` sets the facecolor of the masked
        elements to transparent. You can see the difference when using
        edgecolors. While all edges are drawn irrespective of masking in a
        QuadMesh, the edge between two adjacent masked quadrilaterals in
        `~.Axes.pcolor` is not drawn as the corresponding polygons do not
        exist in the PolyQuadMesh. Because PolyQuadMesh draws each individual
        polygon, it also supports applying hatches and linestyles to the collection.

        Another difference is the support of Gouraud shading in
        `~.Axes.pcolormesh`, which is not available with `~.Axes.pcolor`.
