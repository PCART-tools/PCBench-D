    def polar_second_moment_of_area(self):
        """Returns the polar second moment of area of an Ellipse

        It is a constituent of the second moment of area, linked through
        the perpendicular axis theorem. While the planar second moment of
        area describes an object's resistance to deflection (bending) when
        subjected to a force applied to a plane parallel to the central
        axis, the polar second moment of area describes an object's
        resistance to deflection when subjected to a moment applied in a
        plane perpendicular to the object's central axis (i.e. parallel to
        the cross-section)

        Examples
        ========

        >>> from sympy import symbols, Circle, Ellipse
        >>> c = Circle((5, 5), 4)
        >>> c.polar_second_moment_of_area()
        128*pi
        >>> a, b = symbols('a, b')
        >>> e = Ellipse((0, 0), a, b)
        >>> e.polar_second_moment_of_area()
        pi*a**3*b/4 + pi*a*b**3/4
