        """
        The area of the polygon.

        Notes
        =====

        The area calculation can be positive or negative based on the
        orientation of the points. If any side of the polygon crosses
        any other side, there will be areas having opposite signs.

        Examples
        ========

        >>> from sympy import Point, Polygon
        >>> p1, p2, p3, p4 = map(Point, [(0, 0), (1, 0), (5, 1), (0, 1)])
        >>> poly = Polygon(p1, p2, p3, p4)
        >>> poly.area
        3

        In the Z shaped polygon (with the lower right connecting back
        to the upper left) the areas cancel out:

        >>> Z = Polygon((0, 1), (1, 1), (0, 0), (1, 0))
        >>> Z.area
        0

        In the M shaped polygon, areas do not cancel because no side
        crosses any other (though there is a point of contact).

        >>> M = Polygon((0, 0), (0, 1), (2, 0), (3, 1), (3, 0))
        >>> M.area
        -3/2
