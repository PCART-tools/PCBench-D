    def angle_between(self, o):
        """Angle between the plane and other geometric entity.

        Parameters
        ==========

        LinearEntity3D, Plane.

        Returns
        =======

        angle : angle in radians

        Notes
        =====

        This method accepts only 3D entities as it's parameter, but if you want
        to calculate the angle between a 2D entity and a plane you should
        first convert to a 3D entity by projecting onto a desired plane and
        then proceed to calculate the angle.

        Examples
        ========

        >>> from sympy import Point3D, Line3D, Plane
        >>> a = Plane(Point3D(1, 2, 2), normal_vector=(1, 2, 3))
        >>> b = Line3D(Point3D(1, 3, 4), Point3D(2, 2, 2))
        >>> a.angle_between(b)
        -asin(sqrt(21)/6)
