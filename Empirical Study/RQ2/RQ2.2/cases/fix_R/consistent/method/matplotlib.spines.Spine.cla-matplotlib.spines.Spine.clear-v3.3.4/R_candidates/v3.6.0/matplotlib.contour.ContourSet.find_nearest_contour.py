    def find_nearest_contour(self, x, y, indices=None, pixel=True):
        """
        Find the point in the contour plot that is closest to ``(x, y)``.

        This method does not support filled contours.

        Parameters
        ----------
        x, y : float
            The reference point.
        indices : list of int or None, default: None
            Indices of contour levels to consider.  If None (the default), all
            levels are considered.
        pixel : bool, default: True
            If *True*, measure distance in pixel (screen) space, which is
            useful for manual contour labeling; else, measure distance in axes
            space.

        Returns
        -------
        contour : `.Collection`
            The contour that is closest to ``(x, y)``.
        segment : int
            The index of the `.Path` in *contour* that is closest to
            ``(x, y)``.
        index : int
            The index of the path segment in *segment* that is closest to
            ``(x, y)``.
        xmin, ymin : float
            The point in the contour plot that is closest to ``(x, y)``.
        d2 : float
            The squared distance from ``(xmin, ymin)`` to ``(x, y)``.
        """

        # This function uses a method that is probably quite
        # inefficient based on converting each contour segment to
        # pixel coordinates and then comparing the given point to
        # those coordinates for each contour.  This will probably be
        # quite slow for complex contours, but for normal use it works
        # sufficiently well that the time is not noticeable.
        # Nonetheless, improvements could probably be made.
