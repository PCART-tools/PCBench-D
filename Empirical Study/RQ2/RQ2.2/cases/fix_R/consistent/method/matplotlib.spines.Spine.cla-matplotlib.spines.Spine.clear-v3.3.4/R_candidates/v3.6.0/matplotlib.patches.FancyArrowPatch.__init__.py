        """
        There are two ways for defining an arrow:

        - If *posA* and *posB* are given, a path connecting two points is
          created according to *connectionstyle*. The path will be
          clipped with *patchA* and *patchB* and further shrunken by
          *shrinkA* and *shrinkB*. An arrow is drawn along this
          resulting path using the *arrowstyle* parameter.

        - Alternatively if *path* is provided, an arrow is drawn along this
          path and *patchA*, *patchB*, *shrinkA*, and *shrinkB* are ignored.

        Parameters
        ----------
        posA, posB : (float, float), default: None
            (x, y) coordinates of arrow tail and arrow head respectively.

        path : `~matplotlib.path.Path`, default: None
            If provided, an arrow is drawn along this path and *patchA*,
            *patchB*, *shrinkA*, and *shrinkB* are ignored.

        arrowstyle : str or `.ArrowStyle`, default: 'simple'
            The `.ArrowStyle` with which the fancy arrow is drawn.  If a
            string, it should be one of the available arrowstyle names, with
            optional comma-separated attributes.  The optional attributes are
            meant to be scaled with the *mutation_scale*.  The following arrow
            styles are available:

            %(ArrowStyle:table)s

        connectionstyle : str or `.ConnectionStyle` or None, optional, \
default: 'arc3'
            The `.ConnectionStyle` with which *posA* and *posB* are connected.
            If a string, it should be one of the available connectionstyle
            names, with optional comma-separated attributes.  The following
            connection styles are available:

            %(ConnectionStyle:table)s

        patchA, patchB : `.Patch`, default: None
            Head and tail patches, respectively.

        shrinkA, shrinkB : float, default: 2
            Shrinking factor of the tail and head of the arrow respectively.

        mutation_scale : float, default: 1
            Value with which attributes of *arrowstyle* (e.g., *head_length*)
            will be scaled.

        mutation_aspect : None or float, default: None
            The height of the rectangle will be squeezed by this value before
            the mutation and the mutated box will be stretched by the inverse
            of it.

        Other Parameters
        ----------------
        **kwargs : `.Patch` properties, optional
            Here is a list of available `.Patch` properties:

        %(Patch:kwdoc)s

            In contrast to other patches, the default ``capstyle`` and
            ``joinstyle`` for `FancyArrowPatch` are set to ``"round"``.
