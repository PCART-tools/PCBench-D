        created by `imshow` or `figimage`, `.Collection` created by `pcolor` or
        `scatter`, etc.), or *None* if no such instance has been defined.

        The current image is an attribute of the current Axes, or the nearest
        earlier Axes in the current figure that contains an image.

        Historically, the only colorable artists were images; hence the name
        ``gci`` (get current image).
