        Place ticks on the locations : subs[j] * base**i

        Parameters
        ----------
        base : float, default: 10.0
            The base of the log used, so major ticks are placed at
            ``base**n``, n integer.
        subs : None or str or sequence of float, default: (1.0,)
            Gives the multiples of integer powers of the base at which
            to place ticks.  The default places ticks only at
            integer powers of the base.
            The permitted string values are ``'auto'`` and ``'all'``,
            both of which use an algorithm based on the axis view
            limits to determine whether and how to put ticks between
            integer powers of the base.  With ``'auto'``, ticks are
            placed only between integer powers; with ``'all'``, the
            integer powers are included.  A value of None is
            equivalent to ``'auto'``.
        numticks : None or int, default: None
            The maximum number of ticks to allow on a given axis. The default
            of ``None`` will try to choose intelligently as long as this
            Locator has already been assigned to an axis using
            `~.axis.Axis.get_tick_space`, but otherwise falls back to 9.
