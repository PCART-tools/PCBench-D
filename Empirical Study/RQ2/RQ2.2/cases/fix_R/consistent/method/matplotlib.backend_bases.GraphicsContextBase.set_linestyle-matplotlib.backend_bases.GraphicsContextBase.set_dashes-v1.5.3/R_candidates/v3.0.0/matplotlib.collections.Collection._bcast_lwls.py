    def _bcast_lwls(linewidths, dashes):
        '''Internal helper function to broadcast + scale ls/lw

        In the collection drawing code the linewidth and linestyle are
        cycled through as circular buffers (via v[i % len(v)]).  Thus,
        if we are going to scale the dash pattern at set time (not
        draw time) we need to do the broadcasting now and expand both
        lists to be the same length.

        Parameters
        ----------
        linewidths : list
            line widths of collection

        dashes : list
            dash specification (offset, (dash pattern tuple))

        Returns
        -------
        linewidths, dashes : list
             Will be the same length, dashes are scaled by paired linewidth

            dashes = list(dashes) * (l_lw // gcd)

                  for (o, d), lw in zip(dashes, linewidths)]
