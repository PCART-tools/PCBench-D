        Convert this path to a list of polygons or polylines.  Each
        polygon/polyline is an Nx2 array of vertices.  In other words,
        each polygon has no ``MOVETO`` instructions or curves.  This
        is useful for displaying in backends that do not support
        compound paths or Bezier curves, such as GDK.

        If *width* and *height* are both non-zero then the lines will
        be simplified so that vertices outside of (0, 0), (width,
        height) will be clipped.

        If *closed_only* is `True` (default), only closed polygons,
        with the last point being the same as the first point, will be
        returned.  Any unclosed polylines in the path will be
        explicitly closed.  If *closed_only* is `False`, any unclosed
        polygons in the path will be returned as unclosed polygons,
        and the closed polygons will be returned explicitly closed by
        setting the last point to the same as the first point.
