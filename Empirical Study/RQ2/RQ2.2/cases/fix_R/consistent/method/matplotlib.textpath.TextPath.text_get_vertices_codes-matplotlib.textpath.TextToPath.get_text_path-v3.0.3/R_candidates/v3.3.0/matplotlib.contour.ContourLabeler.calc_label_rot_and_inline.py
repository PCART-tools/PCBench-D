        Calculate the appropriate label rotation given the linecontour
        coordinates in screen units, the index of the label location and the
        label width.

        If *lc* is not None or empty, also break contours and compute
        inlining.

        *spacing* is the empty space to leave around the label, in pixels.

        Both tasks are done together to avoid calculating path lengths
        multiple times, which is relatively costly.

        The method used here involves computing the path length along the
        contour in pixel coordinates and then looking approximately (label
        width / 2) away from central point to determine rotation and then to
        break contour if desired.
