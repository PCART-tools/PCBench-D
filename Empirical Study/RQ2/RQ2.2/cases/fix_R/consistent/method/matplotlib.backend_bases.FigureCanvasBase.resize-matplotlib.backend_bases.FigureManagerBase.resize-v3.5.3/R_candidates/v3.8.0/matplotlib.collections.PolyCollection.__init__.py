        Parameters
        ----------
        verts : list of array-like
            The sequence of polygons [*verts0*, *verts1*, ...] where each
            element *verts_i* defines the vertices of polygon *i* as a 2D
            array-like of shape (M, 2).
        sizes : array-like, default: None
            Squared scaling factors for the polygons. The coordinates of each
            polygon *verts_i* are multiplied by the square-root of the
            corresponding entry in *sizes* (i.e., *sizes* specify the scaling
            of areas). The scaling is applied before the Artist master
            transform.
        closed : bool, default: True
            Whether the polygon should be closed by adding a CLOSEPOLY
            connection at the end.
        **kwargs
            Forwarded to `.Collection`.
