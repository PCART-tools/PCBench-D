    def contains(self, mouseevent, radius=None):
        """
        Test whether the mouse event occurred in the patch.

        Parameters
        ----------
        mouseevent : `~matplotlib.backend_bases.MouseEvent`
            Where the user clicked.

        radius : float, optional
            Additional margin on the patch in target coordinates of
            `.Patch.get_transform`. See `.Path.contains_point` for further
            details.

            If `None`, the default value depends on the state of the object:

            - If `.Artist.get_picker` is a number, the default
              is that value.  This is so that picking works as expected.
            - Otherwise if the edge color has a non-zero alpha, the default
              is half of the linewidth.  This is so that all the colored
              pixels are "in" the patch.
            - Finally, if the edge has 0 alpha, the default is 0.  This is
              so that patches without a stroked edge do not have points
              outside of the filled region report as "in" due to an
              invisible edge.
