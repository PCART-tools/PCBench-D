        Set the pads for constrained_layout.

        Parameters
        ----------
        h_pad, w_pad : float
            Padding around the axes elements in inches.
            Default to :rc:`figure.constrained_layout.h_pad` and
            :rc:`figure.constrained_layout.w_pad`.
        hspace, wspace : float
            Fraction of the figure to dedicate to space between the
            axes.  These are evenly spread between the gaps between the axes.
            A value of 0.2 for a three-column layout would have a space
            of 0.1 of the figure width between each column.
            If h/wspace < h/w_pad, then the pads are used instead.
            Default to :rc:`figure.constrained_layout.hspace` and
            :rc:`figure.constrained_layout.wspace`.
        rect : tuple of 4 floats
            Rectangle in figure coordinates to perform constrained layout in
            (left, bottom, width, height), each from 0-1.
