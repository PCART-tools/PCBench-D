    def set_cursor(self, cursor):
        """
        Set the current cursor.

        This may have no effect if the backend does not display anything.

        If required by the backend, this method should trigger an update in
        the backend event loop after the cursor is set, as this method may be
        called e.g. before a long-running task during which the GUI is not
        updated.

        Parameters
        ----------
        cursor : `.Cursors`
            The cursor to display over the canvas. Note: some backends may
            change the cursor for the entire window.
