    """
    Compute the global size and stride of a DTensor from the given local tensor.
    The local size is multiplited by `world_size` per Sharding dim.
    The local stride is multiplited by `world_size` per Sharding dim, as long as the
    dimension is outside sharding dim.

    For example, if we have a local tensor with size (4, 8, 2) and stride (16, 1, 8).
    If the DTensor placements are [Shard(2)] and world_size is 2;
    then the global size is (4, 8, 4) and stride is (16 * 2, 1, 8).

    Args:
        tensor (:class:`torch.Tensor`):
            Local tensor which DTensor will be constructed from.
        mesh (:class:`DeviceMesh`):
            Object which describes the mesh topology
            of devices for the DTensor.
        placements (Sequence[:class:`Placement`]]):
            The attribute of the DTensor that describes its layout
            on the mesh topology.

    Return:
        tensor_shape: A List of int which specifies the size of DTensor which build
            on top of the local tensor.
        tensor_stride: A List of int which specifies the stride of DTensor.
