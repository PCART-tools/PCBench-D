def get_device_capability(device: "Device" = None) -> tuple[int, int]:
    r"""Get the cuda capability of a device.

    Args:
        device (torch.device or int or str, optional): device for which to return the
            device capability. This function is a no-op if this argument is
            a negative integer. It uses the current device, given by
            :func:`~torch.cuda.current_device`, if :attr:`device` is ``None``
            (default).

    Returns:
        tuple(int, int): the major and minor cuda capability of the device
