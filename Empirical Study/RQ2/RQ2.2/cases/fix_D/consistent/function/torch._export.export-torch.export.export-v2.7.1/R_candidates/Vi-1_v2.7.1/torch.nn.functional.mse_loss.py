    r"""mse_loss(input, target, size_average=None, reduce=None, reduction='mean', weight=None) -> Tensor

    Measures the element-wise mean squared error, with optional weighting.

    Args:
        input (Tensor): Predicted values.
        target (Tensor): Ground truth values.
        size_average (bool, optional): Deprecated (use reduction).
        reduce (bool, optional): Deprecated (use reduction).
        reduction (str, optional): Specifies the reduction to apply to the output:
                                   'none' | 'mean' | 'sum'. 'mean': the mean of the output is taken.
                                   'sum': the output will be summed. 'none': no reduction will be applied.
                                   Default: 'mean'.
        weight (Tensor, optional): Weights for each sample. Default: None.

    Returns:
        Tensor: Mean Squared Error loss (optionally weighted).
