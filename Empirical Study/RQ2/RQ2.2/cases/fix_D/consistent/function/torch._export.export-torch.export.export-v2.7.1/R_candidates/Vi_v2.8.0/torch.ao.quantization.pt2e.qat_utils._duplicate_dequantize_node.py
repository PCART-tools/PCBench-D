def _duplicate_dequantize_node(m: GraphModule):
    """
    Helper function to duplicate all dequantize nodes in the graph if the
    node has more than one user. For example:

    Before:
      quantize -> dequantize -> a
                          \\--> b
                          \\--> c

    After:
      quantize -> dequantize_1 -> a
            \\--> dequantize_2 -> b
            \\--> dequantize_3 -> c

    This is useful for subgraph rewriting. E.g. if we wish to match the
    pattern [dequantize - a] above, subgraph matching would fail because
    the dequantize node has users outside the matched portion of the graph.
    Instead, we match [dequantize_1 - a], which is safe.
