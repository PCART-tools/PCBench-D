    Allow users to call `model.train()` and `model.eval()` on an exported model,
    but with the effect of changing behavior between the two modes limited to special
    ops only, which are currently dropout and batchnorm.

    Note: This does not achieve the same effect as what `model.train()` and `model.eval()`
    does in eager models, but only provides an approximation. In particular, user code
    branching on `training` flag will not function correctly in general because the branch
    is already specialized at export time. Additionally, other ops beyond dropout and batchnorm
    that have different train/eval behavior will also not be converted properly.
