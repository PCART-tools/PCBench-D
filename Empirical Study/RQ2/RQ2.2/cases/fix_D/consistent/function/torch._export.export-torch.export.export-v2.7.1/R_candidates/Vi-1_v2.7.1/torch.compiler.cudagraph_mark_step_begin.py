def cudagraph_mark_step_begin():
    """
    Indicates that a new iteration of inference or training is about to begin.

    CUDA Graphs will free tensors of a prior iteration. A new iteration is started on each invocation of
    torch.compile, so long as there is not a pending backward that has not been called.

    If that heuristic is wrong, such as in the following example, manually mark it with this api.

    .. code-block:: python

        @torch.compile(mode="reduce-overhead")
        def rand_foo():
            return torch.rand([4], device="cuda")

        for _ in range(5):
            torch.compiler.cudagraph_mark_step_begin()
            rand_foo() + rand_foo()

    For more details, see `torch.compiler_cudagraph_trees <https://pytorch.org/docs/main/torch.compiler_cudagraph_trees.html>`__
