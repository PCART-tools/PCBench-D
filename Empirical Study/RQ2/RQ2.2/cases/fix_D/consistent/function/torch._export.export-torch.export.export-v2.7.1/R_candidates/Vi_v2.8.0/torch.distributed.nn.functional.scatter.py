    Scatters a list of tensors to all processes in a group.

    Each process will receive exactly one tensor and store its data in the
    ``tensor`` argument.

    Arguments:
        tensors (list[Tensor]): List of tensors to scatter on the source rank.
            Receivers must pass ``None`.
        src (int, optional): Source rank (default is 0).
        group (ProcessGroup, optional): The process group to work on.

    Returns:
        Tensor: Output tensor from the scatter operation.
