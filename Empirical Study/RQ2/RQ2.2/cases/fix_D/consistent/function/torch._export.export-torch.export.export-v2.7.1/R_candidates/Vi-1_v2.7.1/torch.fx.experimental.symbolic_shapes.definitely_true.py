def definitely_true(a: BoolLikeType) -> bool:
    """
    Returns True only if we can tell that a is True, possibly introducing
    a guard in the process.  If a depends on some unbacked SymInt, we may
    return False even though there may exist a possible value of the SymInt
    that would cause the expression to return True.

    When is it appropriate to use definitely_true?  First, if you can use
    a higher level combinator prefer using those instead, they are definitely
    safe (modulo short-circuiting).
    Second, it can be used if the program would behave equivalently if
    definitely_true always returned False. Finally, it even
    be OK if the program wouldn't behave equivalently, so long as the
    change is semantics preserving.  It can be semantics preserving if
    the program errors in more cases than it did previously (but otherwise
    behaves identically), or if it changes some quantity in a way that
    doesn't matter (e.g., strides often fall in this bucket.)
