def default_partition(

    """
    Partitions the :attr:`joint_module` in a manner that closely resembles the
    behavior observed in the original ``.forward()`` and ``.backward()`` of the
    callable, i.e., the resulting forward graph contains those operators that
    are executed in the original ``.forward()`` callable passed to
    :func:`aot_function`.

    The default partitioner collects the operators that are between the forward
    inputs and the forward outputs. This helps in finding the tensors which have
    to be stashed for the backward pass. These stashed tensors become the output
    of the generated forward graph. The remaining operators are then placed in
    the backward graph.

    .. warning::
        This API is experimental and likely to change.

    Args:
        joint_module(fx.GraphModule): The joint forward and backward graph. This
            is the result of AOT Autograd tracing.

    Returns:
        Returns the generated forward and backward Fx graph modules.
