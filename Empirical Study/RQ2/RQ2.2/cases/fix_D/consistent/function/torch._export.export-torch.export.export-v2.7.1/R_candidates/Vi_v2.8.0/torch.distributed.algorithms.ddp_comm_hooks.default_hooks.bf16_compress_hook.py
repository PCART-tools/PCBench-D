    Warning: This API is experimental, and it requires NCCL version later than 2.9.6.

    This DDP communication hook implements a simple gradient compression
    approach that casts ``GradBucket`` tensor to half-precision
    `Brain floating point format <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bfloat16_floating-point_format>`_ (``torch.bfloat16``)
    and then divides it by the process group size.
    It allreduces those ``bfloat16`` gradient tensors. Once compressed gradient
    tensors are allreduced, the chained callback ``decompress`` casts it back to the input data type (such as ``float32``).

    Example::
        >>> # xdoctest: +SKIP
        >>> ddp_model.register_comm_hook(process_group, bf16_compress_hook)
    """
    return _compress_hook(torch.bfloat16, process_group, bucket)
