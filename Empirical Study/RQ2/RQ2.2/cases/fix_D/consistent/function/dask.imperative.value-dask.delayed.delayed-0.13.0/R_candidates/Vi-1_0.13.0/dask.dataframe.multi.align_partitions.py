def align_partitions(*dfs):

    This serves as precursor to multi-dataframe operations like join, concat,

    Parameters
    ----------
    dfs: sequence of dd.DataFrame, dd.Series and dd.base.Scalar
        Sequence of dataframes to be aligned on their index

    Returns
    -------
    dfs: sequence of dd.DataFrame, dd.Series and dd.base.Scalar
        These must have consistent divisions with each other
    divisions: tuple
        Full divisions sequence of the entire result
    result: list
        A list of lists of keys that show which data exist on which
        divisions
