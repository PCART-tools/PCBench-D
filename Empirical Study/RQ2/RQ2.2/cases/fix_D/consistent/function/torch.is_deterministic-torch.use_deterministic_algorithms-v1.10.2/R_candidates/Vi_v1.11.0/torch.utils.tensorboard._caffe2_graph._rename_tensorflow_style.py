def _rename_tensorflow_style(shapes, blob_name_tracker, ops):
    '''
    Convert some of the common names in Caffe2 to tensorflow.
    NOTE: The common names in both Caffe2 and Tensorflow are currently
        hardcoded, if either side changes at some point, then this code should
        change as well.

    Args:
        shapes: Dictionary mapping blob names to their shapes/dimensions.
        blob_name_tracker: Dictionary of all unique blob names (with respect to
            some context).
        ops: List of Caffe2 operators

    Returns:
        None. The _rename_all() call modifies blob_name_tracker and ops in-place.
