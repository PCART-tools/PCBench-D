def verify_skippables(module: nn.Sequential) -> None:
    """Verifies if the underlying skippable modules satisfy integrity.

    Every skip tensor must have only one pair of `stash` and `pop`. If there
    are one or more unmatched pairs, it will raise :exc:`TypeError` with the
    detailed messages.

    Here are a few failure cases. :func:`verify_skippables` will report failure
    for these cases::

        # Layer1 stashes "1to3".
        # Layer3 pops "1to3".

        nn.Sequential(Layer1(), Layer2())
        #               └──── ?

        nn.Sequential(Layer2(), Layer3())
        #                   ? ────┘

        nn.Sequential(Layer1(), Layer2(), Layer3(), Layer3())
        #               └───────────────────┘       ^^^^^^

        nn.Sequential(Layer1(), Layer1(), Layer2(), Layer3())
        #             ^^^^^^      └───────────────────┘

    To use the same name for multiple skip tensors, they must be isolated by
    different namespaces. See :meth:`isolate()
    <torchpipe.skip.skippable.Skippable.isolate>`.

    Raises:
        TypeError:
            one or more pairs of `stash` and `pop` are not matched.
