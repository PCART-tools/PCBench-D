    The coherence between *x* and *y*.  Coherence is the normalized
    cross spectral density:

    .. math::

        C_{xy} = \frac{|P_{xy}|^2}{P_{xx}P_{yy}}

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y
        Array or sequence containing the data

    %(Spectral)s

    %(PSD)s

    noverlap : int, default: 0 (no overlap)
        The number of points of overlap between segments.

    Returns
    -------
    Cxy : 1-D array
        The coherence vector.
    freqs : 1-D array
            The frequencies for the elements in *Cxy*.
