  """Calls a stageable Python callback.

  `debug_callback` enables you to pass in a Python function that can be called
  inside of a staged JAX program. A `debug_callback` follows existing JAX
  transformation *pure* operational semantics, which are therefore unaware of
  side-effects. This means the effect could be dropped, duplicated, or
  potentially reordered in the presence of higher-order primitives and
  transformations.

  We want this behavior because we'd like `debug_callback` to be "innocuous",
  i.e. we want these primitives to change the JAX computation as little as
  possible while revealing as much about them as possible, such as which parts
  of the computation are duplicated or dropped.

  Args:
    callback: A Python callable. Its return value will be ignored.
    *args: The positional arguments to the callback.
    ordered: A keyword only argument used to indicate whether or not the
      staged out computation will enforce ordering of this callback w.r.t.
      other ordered callbacks.
    **kwargs: The keyword arguments to the callback.
  Returns:
    The value of `callback(*args, **kwargs)`.
