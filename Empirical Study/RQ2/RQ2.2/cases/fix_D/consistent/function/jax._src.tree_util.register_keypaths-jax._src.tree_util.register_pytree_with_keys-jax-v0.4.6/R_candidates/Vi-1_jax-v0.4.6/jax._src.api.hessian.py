  """Hessian of ``fun`` as a dense array.

  Args:
    fun: Function whose Hessian is to be computed.  Its arguments at positions
      specified by ``argnums`` should be arrays, scalars, or standard Python
      containers thereof. It should return arrays, scalars, or standard Python
      containers thereof.
    argnums: Optional, integer or sequence of integers. Specifies which
      positional argument(s) to differentiate with respect to (default ``0``).
    has_aux: Optional, bool. Indicates whether ``fun`` returns a pair where the
      first element is considered the output of the mathematical function to be
      differentiated and the second element is auxiliary data. Default False.
    holomorphic: Optional, bool. Indicates whether ``fun`` is promised to be
      holomorphic. Default False.

  Returns:
    A function with the same arguments as ``fun``, that evaluates the Hessian of
    ``fun``.

  >>> import jax
  >>>
  >>> g = lambda x: x[0]**3 - 2*x[0]*x[1] - x[1]**6
  >>> print(jax.hessian(g)(jax.numpy.array([1., 2.])))
  [[   6.   -2.]
   [  -2. -480.]]

  :py:func:`hessian` is a generalization of the usual definition of the Hessian
  that supports nested Python containers (i.e. pytrees) as inputs and outputs.
  The tree structure of ``jax.hessian(fun)(x)`` is given by forming a tree
  product of the structure of ``fun(x)`` with a tree product of two copies of
  the structure of ``x``. A tree product of two tree structures is formed by
  replacing each leaf of the first tree with a copy of the second. For example:

  >>> import jax.numpy as jnp
  >>> f = lambda dct: {"c": jnp.power(dct["a"], dct["b"])}
  >>> print(jax.hessian(f)({"a": jnp.arange(2.) + 1., "b": jnp.arange(2.) + 2.}))
  {'c': {'a': {'a': Array([[[ 2.,  0.], [ 0.,  0.]],
                           [[ 0.,  0.], [ 0., 12.]]], dtype=float32),
               'b': Array([[[ 1.      ,  0.      ], [ 0.      ,  0.      ]],
                           [[ 0.      ,  0.      ], [ 0.      , 12.317766]]], dtype=float32)},
         'b': {'a': Array([[[ 1.      ,  0.      ], [ 0.      ,  0.      ]],
                           [[ 0.      ,  0.      ], [ 0.      , 12.317766]]], dtype=float32),
               'b': Array([[[0.      , 0.      ], [0.      , 0.      ]],
                           [[0.      , 0.      ], [0.      , 3.843624]]], dtype=float32)}}}

  Thus each leaf in the tree structure of ``jax.hessian(fun)(x)`` corresponds to
  a leaf of ``fun(x)`` and a pair of leaves of ``x``. For each leaf in
  ``jax.hessian(fun)(x)``, if the corresponding array leaf of ``fun(x)`` has
  shape ``(out_1, out_2, ...)`` and the corresponding array leaves of ``x`` have
  shape ``(in_1_1, in_1_2, ...)`` and ``(in_2_1, in_2_2, ...)`` respectively,
  then the Hessian leaf has shape ``(out_1, out_2, ..., in_1_1, in_1_2, ...,
  in_2_1, in_2_2, ...)``. In other words, the Python tree structure represents
  the block structure of the Hessian, with blocks determined by the input and
  output pytrees.

  In particular, an array is produced (with no pytrees involved) when the
  function input ``x`` and output ``fun(x)`` are each a single array, as in the
  ``g`` example above. If ``fun(x)`` has shape ``(out1, out2, ...)`` and ``x``
  has shape ``(in1, in2, ...)`` then ``jax.hessian(fun)(x)`` has shape
  ``(out1, out2, ..., in1, in2, ..., in1, in2, ...)``. To flatten pytrees into
  1D vectors, consider using :py:func:`jax.flatten_util.flatten_pytree`.
