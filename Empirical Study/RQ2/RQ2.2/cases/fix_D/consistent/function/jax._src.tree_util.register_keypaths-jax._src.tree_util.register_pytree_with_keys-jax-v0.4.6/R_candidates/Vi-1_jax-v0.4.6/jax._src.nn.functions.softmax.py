  Computes the function which rescales elements to the range :math:`[0, 1]`
  such that the elements along :code:`axis` sum to :math:`1`.

  Args:
    x : input array
    axis: the axis or axes along which the softmax should be computed. The
      softmax output summed across these dimensions should sum to :math:`1`.
      Either an integer or a tuple of integers.
    where: Elements to include in the :code:`softmax`.
    initial: The minimum value used to shift the input array. Must be present
      when :code:`where` is not None.
