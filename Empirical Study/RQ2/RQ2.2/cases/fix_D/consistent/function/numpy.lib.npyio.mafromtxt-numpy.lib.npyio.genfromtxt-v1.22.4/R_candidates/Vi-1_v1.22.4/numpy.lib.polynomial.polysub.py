def polysub(a1, a2):
    """
    Difference (subtraction) of two polynomials.

    .. note::
       This forms part of the old polynomial API. Since version 1.4, the
       new polynomial API defined in `numpy.polynomial` is preferred.
       A summary of the differences can be found in the
       :doc:`transition guide </reference/routines.polynomials>`.

    Given two polynomials `a1` and `a2`, returns ``a1 - a2``.
    `a1` and `a2` can be either array_like sequences of the polynomials'
    coefficients (including coefficients equal to zero), or `poly1d` objects.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a1, a2 : array_like or poly1d
        Minuend and subtrahend polynomials, respectively.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray or poly1d
        Array or `poly1d` object of the difference polynomial's coefficients.

    See Also
    --------
    polyval, polydiv, polymul, polyadd

    Examples
    --------
    .. math:: (2 x^2 + 10 x - 2) - (3 x^2 + 10 x -4) = (-x^2 + 2)

    >>> np.polysub([2, 10, -2], [3, 10, -4])
