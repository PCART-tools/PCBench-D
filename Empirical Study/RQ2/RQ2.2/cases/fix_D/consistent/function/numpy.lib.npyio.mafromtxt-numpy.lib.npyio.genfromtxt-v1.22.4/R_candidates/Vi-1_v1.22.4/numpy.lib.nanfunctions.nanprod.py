    Return the product of array elements over a given axis treating Not a
    Numbers (NaNs) as ones.

    One is returned for slices that are all-NaN or empty.

    .. versionadded:: 1.10.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Array containing numbers whose product is desired. If `a` is not an
        array, a conversion is attempted.
    axis : {int, tuple of int, None}, optional
        Axis or axes along which the product is computed. The default is to compute
        the product of the flattened array.
    dtype : data-type, optional
        The type of the returned array and of the accumulator in which the
        elements are summed.  By default, the dtype of `a` is used.  An
        exception is when `a` has an integer type with less precision than
        the platform (u)intp. In that case, the default will be either
        (u)int32 or (u)int64 depending on whether the platform is 32 or 64
        bits. For inexact inputs, dtype must be inexact.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternate output array in which to place the result.  The default
        is ``None``. If provided, it must have the same shape as the
        expected output, but the type will be cast if necessary. See
        :ref:`ufuncs-output-type` for more details. The casting of NaN to integer
        can yield unexpected results.
    keepdims : bool, optional
        If True, the axes which are reduced are left in the result as
        dimensions with size one. With this option, the result will
        broadcast correctly against the original `arr`.
    initial : scalar, optional
        The starting value for this product. See `~numpy.ufunc.reduce`
        for details.

        .. versionadded:: 1.22.0
    where : array_like of bool, optional
        Elements to include in the product. See `~numpy.ufunc.reduce`
        for details.

        .. versionadded:: 1.22.0

    Returns
    -------
    nanprod : ndarray
        A new array holding the result is returned unless `out` is
        specified, in which case it is returned.

    --------

    isnan : Show which elements are NaN.

    Examples
    --------

    1
    >>> np.nanprod([1])
    1
    >>> np.nanprod([1, np.nan])
    1.0
    >>> a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, np.nan]])
    >>> np.nanprod(a)
    6.0
    >>> np.nanprod(a, axis=0)
    array([3., 2.])
