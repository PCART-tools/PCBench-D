@array_function_dispatch(_broadcast_arrays_dispatcher, module='numpy')
def broadcast_arrays(*args, subok=False):
    """
    Broadcast any number of arrays against each other.

    Parameters
    ----------
    `*args` : array_likes
        The arrays to broadcast.

    subok : bool, optional
        If True, then sub-classes will be passed-through, otherwise
        the returned arrays will be forced to be a base-class array (default).

    Returns
    -------
    broadcasted : list of arrays
        These arrays are views on the original arrays.  They are typically
        not contiguous.  Furthermore, more than one element of a
        broadcasted array may refer to a single memory location. If you need
        to write to the arrays, make copies first. While you can set the
        ``writable`` flag True, writing to a single output value may end up
        changing more than one location in the output array.

        .. deprecated:: 1.17
            The output is currently marked so that if written to, a deprecation
            warning will be emitted. A future version will set the
            ``writable`` flag False so writing to it will raise an error.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.array([[1,2,3]])
    >>> y = np.array([[4],[5]])
    >>> np.broadcast_arrays(x, y)
    [array([[1, 2, 3],
           [1, 2, 3]]), array([[4, 4, 4],
           [5, 5, 5]])]

    Here is a useful idiom for getting contiguous copies instead of
    non-contiguous views.

    >>> [np.array(a) for a in np.broadcast_arrays(x, y)]
    [array([[1, 2, 3],
           [1, 2, 3]]), array([[4, 4, 4],
           [5, 5, 5]])]
