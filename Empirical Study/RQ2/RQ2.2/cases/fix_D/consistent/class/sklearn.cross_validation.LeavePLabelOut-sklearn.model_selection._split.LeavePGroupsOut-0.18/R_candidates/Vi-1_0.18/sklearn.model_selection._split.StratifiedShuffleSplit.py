class StratifiedShuffleSplit(BaseShuffleSplit):
    """Stratified ShuffleSplit cross-validator

    Provides train/test indices to split data in train/test sets.

    This cross-validation object is a merge of StratifiedKFold and
    ShuffleSplit, which returns stratified randomized folds. The folds
    are made by preserving the percentage of samples for each class.

    Note: like the ShuffleSplit strategy, stratified random splits
    do not guarantee that all folds will be different, although this is
    still very likely for sizeable datasets.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <cross_validation>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_splits : int (default 10)
        Number of re-shuffling & splitting iterations.

    test_size : float (default 0.1), int, or None
        If float, should be between 0.0 and 1.0 and represent the
        proportion of the dataset to include in the test split. If
        int, represents the absolute number of test samples. If None,
        the value is automatically set to the complement of the train size.

    train_size : float, int, or None (default is None)
        If float, should be between 0.0 and 1.0 and represent the
        proportion of the dataset to include in the train split. If
        int, represents the absolute number of train samples. If None,
        the value is automatically set to the complement of the test size.

    random_state : int or RandomState
        Pseudo-random number generator state used for random sampling.
