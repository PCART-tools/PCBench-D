class TimerBase:
    """
    A base class for providing timer events, useful for things animations.
    Backends need to implement a few specific methods in order to use their
    own timing mechanisms so that the timer events are integrated into their
    event loops.

    Subclasses must override the following methods:

    - ``_timer_start``: Backend-specific code for starting the timer.
    - ``_timer_stop``: Backend-specific code for stopping the timer.

    Subclasses may additionally override the following methods:

    - ``_timer_set_single_shot``: Code for setting the timer to single shot
      operating mode, if supported by the timer object.  If not, the `Timer`
      class itself will store the flag and the ``_on_timer`` method should be
      overridden to support such behavior.

    - ``_timer_set_interval``: Code for setting the interval on the timer, if
      there is a method for doing so on the timer object.

    - ``_on_timer``: The internal function that any timer object should call,
      which will handle the task of running all callbacks that have been set.
