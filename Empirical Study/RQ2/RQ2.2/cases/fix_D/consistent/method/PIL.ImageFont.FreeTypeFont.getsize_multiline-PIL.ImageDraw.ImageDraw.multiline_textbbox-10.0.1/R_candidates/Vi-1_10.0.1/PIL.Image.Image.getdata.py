        Returns the contents of this image as a sequence object
        containing pixel values.  The sequence object is flattened, so
        that values for line one follow directly after the values of
        line zero, and so on.

        Note that the sequence object returned by this method is an
        internal PIL data type, which only supports certain sequence
        operations.  To convert it to an ordinary sequence (e.g. for
        printing), use ``list(im.getdata())``.

           all bands.  To return a single band, pass in the index
           value (e.g. 0 to get the "R" band from an "RGB" image).
