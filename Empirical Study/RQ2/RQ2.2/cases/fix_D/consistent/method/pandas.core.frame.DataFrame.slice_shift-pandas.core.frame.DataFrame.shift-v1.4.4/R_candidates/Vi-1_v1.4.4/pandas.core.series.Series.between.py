    def between(self, left, right, inclusive="both") -> Series:
        """
        Return boolean Series equivalent to left <= series <= right.

        This function returns a boolean vector containing `True` wherever the
        corresponding Series element is between the boundary values `left` and
        `right`. NA values are treated as `False`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        left : scalar or list-like
            Left boundary.
        right : scalar or list-like
            Right boundary.
        inclusive : {"both", "neither", "left", "right"}
            Include boundaries. Whether to set each bound as closed or open.

            .. versionchanged:: 1.3.0

        Returns
        -------
        Series
            Series representing whether each element is between left and
            right (inclusive).

        See Also
        --------
        Series.gt : Greater than of series and other.
        Series.lt : Less than of series and other.

        Notes
        -----
        This function is equivalent to ``(left <= ser) & (ser <= right)``

        Examples
        --------
        >>> s = pd.Series([2, 0, 4, 8, np.nan])

        Boundary values are included by default:

        >>> s.between(1, 4)
        0     True
        1    False
        2     True
        3    False
        4    False
        dtype: bool

        With `inclusive` set to ``"neither"`` boundary values are excluded:

        >>> s.between(1, 4, inclusive="neither")
        0     True
        1    False
        2    False
        3    False
        4    False
        dtype: bool

        `left` and `right` can be any scalar value:

        >>> s = pd.Series(['Alice', 'Bob', 'Carol', 'Eve'])
        >>> s.between('Anna', 'Daniel')
        0    False
        1     True
        2     True
        3    False
        dtype: bool
