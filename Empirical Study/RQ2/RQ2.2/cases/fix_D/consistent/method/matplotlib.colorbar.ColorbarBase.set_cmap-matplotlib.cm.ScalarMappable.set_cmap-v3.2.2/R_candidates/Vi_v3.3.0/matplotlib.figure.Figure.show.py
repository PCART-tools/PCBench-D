        If using a GUI backend with pyplot, display the figure window.

        If the figure was not created using `~.pyplot.figure`, it will lack
        a `~.backend_bases.FigureManagerBase`, and this method will raise an
        AttributeError.

        .. warning::

            This does not manage an GUI event loop. Consequently, the figure
            may only be shown briefly or not shown at all if you or your
            environment are not managing an event loop.

            Proper use cases for `.Figure.show` include running this from a
            GUI application or an IPython shell.

            If you're running a pure python shell or executing a non-GUI
            python script, you should use `matplotlib.pyplot.show` instead,
            which takes care of managing the event loop for you.

        Parameters
        ----------
        warn : bool, default: True
            If ``True`` and we are not running headless (i.e. on Linux with an
            unset DISPLAY), issue warning when called on a non-GUI backend.
