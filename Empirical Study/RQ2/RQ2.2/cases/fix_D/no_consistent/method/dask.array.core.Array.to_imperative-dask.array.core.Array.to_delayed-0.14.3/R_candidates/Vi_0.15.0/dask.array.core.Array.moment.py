        """Calculate the nth centralized moment.

        Parameters
        ----------
        order : int
            Order of the moment that is returned, must be >= 2.
        axis : int, optional
            Axis along which the central moment is computed. The default is to
            compute the moment of the flattened array.
        dtype : data-type, optional
            Type to use in computing the moment. For arrays of integer type the
            default is float64; for arrays of float types it is the same as the
            array type.
        keepdims : bool, optional
            If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left in the
            result as dimensions with size one. With this option, the result
            will broadcast correctly against the original array.
        ddof : int, optional
            "Delta Degrees of Freedom": the divisor used in the calculation is
            N - ddof, where N represents the number of elements. By default
            ddof is zero.

        Returns
        -------
        moment : ndarray
