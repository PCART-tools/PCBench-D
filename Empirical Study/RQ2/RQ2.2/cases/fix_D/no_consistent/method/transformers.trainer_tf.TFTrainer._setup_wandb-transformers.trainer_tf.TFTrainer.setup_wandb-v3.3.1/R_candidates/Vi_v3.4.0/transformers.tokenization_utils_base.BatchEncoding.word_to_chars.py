        Get the character span in the original string corresponding to given word in a sequence
        of the batch.

        Character spans are returned as a CharSpan NamedTuple with:

        - start: index of the first character in the original string
        - end: index of the character following the last character in the original string

        Can be called as:

        - ``self.word_to_chars(word_index)`` if batch size is 1
        - ``self.word_to_chars(batch_index, word_index)`` if batch size is greater or equal to 1

        Args:
            batch_or_word_index (:obj:`int`):
                Index of the sequence in the batch. If the batch only comprise one sequence,
                this can be the index of the word in the sequence
            word_index (:obj:`int`, `optional`):
                If a batch index is provided in `batch_or_token_index`, this can be the index
                of the word in the sequence.

        Returns:
            :obj:`CharSpan` or :obj:`List[CharSpan]`:
                Span(s) of the associated character or characters in the string.
                CharSpan are NamedTuple with:
