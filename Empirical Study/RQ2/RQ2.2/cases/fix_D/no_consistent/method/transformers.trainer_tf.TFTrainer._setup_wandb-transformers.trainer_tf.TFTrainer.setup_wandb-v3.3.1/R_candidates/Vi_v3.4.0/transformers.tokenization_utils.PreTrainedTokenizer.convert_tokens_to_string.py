        Converts a sequence of token ids in a single string.

        The most simple way to do it is ``" ".join(tokens)`` but we often want to remove
        sub-word tokenization artifacts at the same time.

        Args:
            tokens (:obj:`List[str]`): The token to join in a string.

        Return: The joined tokens.
