        """
        Get the index of the token in the encoded output comprising a character
        in the original string for a sequence of the batch.

        Can be called as:

        - ``self.char_to_token(char_index)`` if batch size is 1
        - ``self.char_to_token(batch_index, char_index)`` if batch size is greater or equal to 1

        This method is particularly suited when the input sequences are provided as
        pre-tokenized sequences (i.e. words are defined by the user). In this case it allows
        to easily associate encoded tokens with provided tokenized words.

        Args:
            batch_or_char_index (:obj:`int`):
                Index of the sequence in the batch. If the batch only comprise one sequence,
                this can be the index of the word in the sequence
            char_index (:obj:`int`, `optional`):
                If a batch index is provided in `batch_or_token_index`, this can be the index
                of the word in the sequence.


        Returns:
            :obj:`int`: Index of the token.
