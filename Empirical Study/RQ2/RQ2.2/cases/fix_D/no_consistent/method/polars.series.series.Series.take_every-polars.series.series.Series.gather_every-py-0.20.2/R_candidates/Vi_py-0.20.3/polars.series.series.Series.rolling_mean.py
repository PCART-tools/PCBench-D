        """
        Apply a rolling mean (moving mean) over the values in this array.

        A window of length `window_size` will traverse the array. The values that fill
        this window will (optionally) be multiplied with the weights given by the
        `weight` vector. The resulting values will be aggregated to their mean.

        The window at a given row will include the row itself and the `window_size - 1`
        elements before it.

        Parameters
        ----------
        window_size
            The length of the window.
        weights
            An optional slice with the same length as the window that will be multiplied
            elementwise with the values in the window.
        min_periods
            The number of values in the window that should be non-null before computing
            a result. If None, it will be set equal to:

            - the window size, if `window_size` is a fixed integer
            - 1, if `window_size` is a dynamic temporal size
        center
            Set the labels at the center of the window

        --------
        >>> s = pl.Series("a", [100, 200, 300, 400, 500])
        >>> s.rolling_mean(window_size=2)
