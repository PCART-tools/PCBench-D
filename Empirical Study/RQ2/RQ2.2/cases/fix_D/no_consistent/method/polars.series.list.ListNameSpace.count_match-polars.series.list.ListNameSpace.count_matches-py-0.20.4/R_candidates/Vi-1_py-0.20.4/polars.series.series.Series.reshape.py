    def reshape(self, dimensions: tuple[int, ...]) -> Series:
        """
        Reshape this Series to a flat Series or a Series of Lists.

        Parameters
        ----------
        dimensions
            Tuple of the dimension sizes. If a -1 is used in any of the dimensions, that
            dimension is inferred.

        Returns
        -------
        Series
            If a single dimension is given, results in a Series of the original
            data type.
            If a multiple dimensions are given, results in a Series of data type
            :class:`List` with shape (rows, cols).
