    def sum(self) -> int | float:
        """
        Reduce this Series to the sum value.

        Notes
        -----
        Dtypes in {Int8, UInt8, Int16, UInt16} are cast to
        Int64 before summing to prevent overflow issues.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> s = pl.Series("a", [1, 2, 3])
        >>> s.sum()
        6
        """
        return self._s.sum()
