    def show(self, warn=True):
        """
        If using a GUI backend with pyplot, display the figure window.

        If the figure was not created using `~.pyplot.figure`, it will lack
        a `~.backend_bases.FigureManagerBase`, and this method will raise an
        AttributeError.

        .. warning::

            This does not manage an GUI event loop. Consequently, the figure
            may only be shown briefly or not shown at all if you or your
            environment are not managing an event loop.

            Use cases for `.Figure.show` include running this from a GUI
            application (where there is persistently an event loop running) or
            from a shell, like IPython, that install an input hook to allow the
            interactive shell to accept input while the figure is also being
            shown and interactive.  Some, but not all, GUI toolkits will
            register an input hook on import.  See :ref:`cp_integration` for
            more details.

            If you're in a shell without input hook integration or executing a
            python script, you should use `matplotlib.pyplot.show` with
            ``block=True`` instead, which takes care of starting and running
            the event loop for you.

        Parameters
        ----------
        warn : bool, default: True
            If ``True`` and we are not running headless (i.e. on Linux with an
            unset DISPLAY), issue warning when called on a non-GUI backend.
