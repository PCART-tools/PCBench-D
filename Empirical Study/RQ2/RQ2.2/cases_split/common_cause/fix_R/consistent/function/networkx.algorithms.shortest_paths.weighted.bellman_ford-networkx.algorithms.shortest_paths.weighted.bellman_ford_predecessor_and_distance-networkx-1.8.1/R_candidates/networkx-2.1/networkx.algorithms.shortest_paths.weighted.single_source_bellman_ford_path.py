def single_source_bellman_ford_path(G, source, cutoff=None, weight='weight'):
    """Compute shortest path between source and all other reachable
    nodes for a weighted graph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    source : node
       Starting node for path.

    weight: string, optional (default='weight')
       Edge data key corresponding to the edge weight

    cutoff : integer or float, optional
       Depth to stop the search. Only paths of length <= cutoff are returned.

    Returns
    -------
    paths : dictionary
       Dictionary of shortest path lengths keyed by target.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G=nx.path_graph(5)
    >>> path=nx.single_source_bellman_ford_path(G,0)
    >>> path[4]
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

    Notes
    -----
    Edge weight attributes must be numerical.
    Distances are calculated as sums of weighted edges traversed.
