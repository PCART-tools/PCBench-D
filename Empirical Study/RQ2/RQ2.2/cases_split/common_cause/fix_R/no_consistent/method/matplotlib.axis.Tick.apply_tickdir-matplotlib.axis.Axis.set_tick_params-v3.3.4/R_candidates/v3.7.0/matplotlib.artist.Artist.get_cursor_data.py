    def get_cursor_data(self, event):
        """
        Return the cursor data for a given event.

        .. note::
            This method is intended to be overridden by artist subclasses.
            As an end-user of Matplotlib you will most likely not call this
            method yourself.

        Cursor data can be used by Artists to provide additional context
        information for a given event. The default implementation just returns
        *None*.

        Subclasses can override the method and return arbitrary data. However,
        when doing so, they must ensure that `.format_cursor_data` can convert
        the data to a string representation.

        The only current use case is displaying the z-value of an `.AxesImage`
        in the status bar of a plot window, while moving the mouse.

        Parameters
        ----------
        event : `matplotlib.backend_bases.MouseEvent`
