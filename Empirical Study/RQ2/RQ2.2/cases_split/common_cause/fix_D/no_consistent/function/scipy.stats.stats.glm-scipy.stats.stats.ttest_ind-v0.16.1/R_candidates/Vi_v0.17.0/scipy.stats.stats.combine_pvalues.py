def combine_pvalues(pvalues, method='fisher', weights=None):
    """
    Methods for combining the p-values of independent tests bearing upon the
    same hypothesis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pvalues : array_like, 1-D
        Array of p-values assumed to come from independent tests.
    method : {'fisher', 'stouffer'}, optional
        Name of method to use to combine p-values. The following methods are
        available:

        - "fisher": Fisher's method (Fisher's combined probability test),
          the default.
        - "stouffer": Stouffer's Z-score method.
    weights : array_like, 1-D, optional
        Optional array of weights used only for Stouffer's Z-score method.

    Returns
    -------
    statistic: float
        The statistic calculated by the specified method:
        - "fisher": The chi-squared statistic
        - "stouffer": The Z-score
    pval: float
        The combined p-value.

    Notes
    -----
    Fisher's method (also known as Fisher's combined probability test) [1]_ uses
    a chi-squared statistic to compute a combined p-value. The closely related
    Stouffer's Z-score method [2]_ uses Z-scores rather than p-values. The
    advantage of Stouffer's method is that it is straightforward to introduce
    weights, which can make Stouffer's method more powerful than Fisher's
    method when the p-values are from studies of different size [3]_ [4]_.

    Fisher's method may be extended to combine p-values from dependent tests
    [5]_. Extensions such as Brown's method and Kost's method are not currently
    implemented.
