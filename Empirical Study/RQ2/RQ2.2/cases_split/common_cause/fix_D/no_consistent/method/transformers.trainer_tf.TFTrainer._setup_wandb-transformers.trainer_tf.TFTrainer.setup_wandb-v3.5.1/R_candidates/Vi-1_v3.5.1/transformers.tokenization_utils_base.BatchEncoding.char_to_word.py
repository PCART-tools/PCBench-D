    def char_to_word(self, batch_or_char_index: int, char_index: Optional[int] = None) -> int:
        """
        Get the word in the original string corresponding to a character in the original string of a sequence of the
        batch.

        Can be called as:

        - ``self.char_to_word(char_index)`` if batch size is 1
        - ``self.char_to_word(batch_index, char_index)`` if batch size is greater than 1

        This method is particularly suited when the input sequences are provided as pre-tokenized sequences (i.e. words
        are defined by the user). In this case it allows to easily associate encoded tokens with provided tokenized
        words.

        Args:
            batch_or_char_index (:obj:`int`):
                Index of the sequence in the batch. If the batch only comprise one sequence, this can be the index of
                the character in the original string.
            char_index (:obj:`int`, `optional`):
                If a batch index is provided in `batch_or_token_index`, this can be the index of the character in the
                original string.


        Returns:
            :obj:`int` or :obj:`List[int]`: Index or indices of the associated encoded token(s).
