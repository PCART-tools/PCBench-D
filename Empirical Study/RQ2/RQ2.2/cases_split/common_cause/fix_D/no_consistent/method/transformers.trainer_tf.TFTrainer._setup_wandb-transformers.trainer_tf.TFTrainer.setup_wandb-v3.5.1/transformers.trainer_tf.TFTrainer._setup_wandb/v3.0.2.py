        One can override this method to customize the setup if needed.  Find more information at https://docs.wandb.com/huggingface
        You can also override the following environment variables:

        Environment:
            WANDB_PROJECT:
                (Optional): str - "huggingface" by default, set this to a custom string to store results in a different project
            WANDB_DISABLED:
                (Optional): boolean - defaults to false, set to "true" to disable wandb entirely
        """
        logger.info('Automatic Weights & Biases logging enabled, to disable set os.environ["WANDB_DISABLED"] = "true"')
        wandb.init(project=os.getenv("WANDB_PROJECT", "huggingface"), config=vars(self.args))
