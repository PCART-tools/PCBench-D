        """ Map a function over blocks of the array with some overlap

        We share neighboring zones between blocks of the array, then map a
        function, then trim away the neighboring strips.

        Parameters
        ----------

        func: function
            The function to apply to each extended block
        depth: int, tuple, or dict
            The number of cells that each block should share with its neighbors
            If a tuple or dict this can be different per axis
        boundary: str, tuple, dict
            how to handle the boundaries.  Values include 'reflect',
            'periodic', 'nearest', 'none', or any constant value like 0 or
            np.nan
        trim: bool
            Whether or not to trim the excess after the map function.  Set this
            to false if your mapping function does this for you.
        **kwargs:
            Other keyword arguments valid in ``map_blocks``
