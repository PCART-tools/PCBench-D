        """
        Reinterpret the underlying bits as a signed/unsigned integer.

        This operation is only allowed for 64bit integers. For lower bits integers,
        you can safely use that cast operation.

        Parameters
        ----------
        signed
            If True, reinterpret as `pl.Int64`. Otherwise, reinterpret as `pl.UInt64`.
