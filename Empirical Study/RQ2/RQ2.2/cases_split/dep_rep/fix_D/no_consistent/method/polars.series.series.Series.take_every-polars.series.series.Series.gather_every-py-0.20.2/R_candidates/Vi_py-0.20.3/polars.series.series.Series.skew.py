    def skew(self, *, bias: bool = True) -> float | None:
        r"""
        Compute the sample skewness of a data set.

        For normally distributed data, the skewness should be about zero. For
        unimodal continuous distributions, a skewness value greater than zero means
        that there is more weight in the right tail of the distribution. The
        function `skewtest` can be used to determine if the skewness value
        is close enough to zero, statistically speaking.


        See scipy.stats for more information.

        Parameters
        ----------
        bias : bool, optional
            If False, the calculations are corrected for statistical bias.

        Notes
        -----
        The sample skewness is computed as the Fisher-Pearson coefficient
        of skewness, i.e.

        .. math:: g_1=\frac{m_3}{m_2^{3/2}}

        where

        .. math:: m_i=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N(x[n]-\bar{x})^i

        is the biased sample :math:`i\texttt{th}` central moment, and
        :math:`\bar{x}` is
        the sample mean.  If `bias` is False, the calculations are
        corrected for bias and the value computed is the adjusted
        Fisher-Pearson standardized moment coefficient, i.e.

        .. math::
            G_1 = \frac{k_3}{k_2^{3/2}} = \frac{\sqrt{N(N-1)}}{N-2}\frac{m_3}{m_2^{3/2}}

        Examples
        --------
        >>> s = pl.Series([1, 2, 2, 4, 5])
        >>> s.skew()
        0.34776706224699483

        """
        return self._s.skew(bias)
