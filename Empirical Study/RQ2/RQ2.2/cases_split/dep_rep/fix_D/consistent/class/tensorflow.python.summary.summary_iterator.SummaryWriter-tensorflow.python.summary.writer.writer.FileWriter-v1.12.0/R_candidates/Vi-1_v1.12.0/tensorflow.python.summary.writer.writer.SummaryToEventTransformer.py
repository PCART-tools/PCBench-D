    On construction the summary writer creates a new event file in `logdir`.
    This event file will contain `Event` protocol buffers constructed when you
    call one of the following functions: `add_summary()`, `add_session_log()`,
    `add_event()`, or `add_graph()`.

    If you pass a `Graph` to the constructor it is added to
    the event file. (This is equivalent to calling `add_graph()` later).

    TensorBoard will pick the graph from the file and display it graphically so
    you can interactively explore the graph you built. You will usually pass
    the graph from the session in which you launched it:

    ```python
    ...create a graph...
    # Launch the graph in a session.
    sess = tf.Session()
    # Create a summary writer, add the 'graph' to the event file.
    writer = tf.summary.FileWriter(<some-directory>, sess.graph)
