class MouseEvent(LocationEvent):
    """
    A mouse event ('button_press_event', 'button_release_event', \
'scroll_event', 'motion_notify_event').

    A MouseEvent has a number of special attributes in addition to those
    defined by the parent `Event` and `LocationEvent` classes.

    Attributes
    ----------
    button : None or `MouseButton` or {'up', 'down'}
        The button pressed. 'up' and 'down' are used for scroll events.
        Note that LEFT and RIGHT actually refer to the "primary" and
        "secondary" buttons, i.e. if the user inverts their left and right
        buttons ("left-handed setting") then the LEFT button will be the one
        physically on the right.

    key : None or str
        The key pressed when the mouse event triggered, e.g. 'shift'.
        See `KeyEvent`.

        .. warning::
           This key is currently obtained from the last 'key_press_event' or
           'key_release_event' that occurred within the canvas.  Thus, if the
           last change of keyboard state occurred while the canvas did not have
           focus, this attribute will be wrong.

    step : float
        The number of scroll steps (positive for 'up', negative for 'down').
        This applies only to 'scroll_event' and defaults to 0 otherwise.

    dblclick : bool
        Whether the event is a double-click. This applies only to
        'button_press_event' and is False otherwise. In particular, it's
        not used in 'button_release_event'.

    Examples
    --------
    ::

        def on_press(event):
            print('you pressed', event.button, event.xdata, event.ydata)

        cid = fig.canvas.mpl_connect('button_press_event', on_press)
