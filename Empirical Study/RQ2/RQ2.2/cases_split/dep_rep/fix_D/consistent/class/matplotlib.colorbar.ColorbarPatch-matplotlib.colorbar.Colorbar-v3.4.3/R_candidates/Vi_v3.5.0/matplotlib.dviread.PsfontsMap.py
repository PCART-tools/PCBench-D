class PsfontsMap:
    """
    A psfonts.map formatted file, mapping TeX fonts to PS fonts.

    Parameters
    ----------
    filename : str or path-like

    Notes
    -----
    For historical reasons, TeX knows many Type-1 fonts by different
    names than the outside world. (For one thing, the names have to
    fit in eight characters.) Also, TeX's native fonts are not Type-1
    but Metafont, which is nontrivial to convert to PostScript except
    as a bitmap. While high-quality conversions to Type-1 format exist
    and are shipped with modern TeX distributions, we need to know
    which Type-1 fonts are the counterparts of which native fonts. For
    these reasons a mapping is needed from internal font names to font
    file names.

    A texmf tree typically includes mapping files called e.g.
    :file:`psfonts.map`, :file:`pdftex.map`, or :file:`dvipdfm.map`.
    The file :file:`psfonts.map` is used by :program:`dvips`,
    :file:`pdftex.map` by :program:`pdfTeX`, and :file:`dvipdfm.map`
    by :program:`dvipdfm`. :file:`psfonts.map` might avoid embedding
    the 35 PostScript fonts (i.e., have no filename for them, as in
    the Times-Bold example above), while the pdf-related files perhaps
    only avoid the "Base 14" pdf fonts. But the user may have
    configured these files differently.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> map = PsfontsMap(find_tex_file('pdftex.map'))
    >>> entry = map[b'ptmbo8r']
    >>> entry.texname
    b'ptmbo8r'
    >>> entry.psname
    b'Times-Bold'
    >>> entry.encoding
    '/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/fonts/enc/dvips/base/8r.enc'
    >>> entry.effects
    {'slant': 0.16700000000000001}
    >>> entry.filename
