        Check each table name in `table_names` for rows with invalid foreign
        key references. This method is intended to be used in conjunction with
        `disable_constraint_checking()` and `enable_constraint_checking()`, to
        determine if rows with invalid references were entered while constraint
        checks were off.

        encountered (if any) and provide detailed information about the
        invalid reference in the error message.
