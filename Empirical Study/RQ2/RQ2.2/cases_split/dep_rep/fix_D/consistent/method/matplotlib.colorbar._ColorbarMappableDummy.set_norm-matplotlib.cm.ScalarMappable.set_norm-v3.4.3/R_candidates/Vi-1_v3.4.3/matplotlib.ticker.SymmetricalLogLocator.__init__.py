        Parameters
        ----------
        transform : `~.scale.SymmetricalLogTransform`, optional
            If set, defines the *base* and *linthresh* of the symlog transform.
        base, linthresh : float, optional
            The *base* and *linthresh* of the symlog transform, as documented
            for `.SymmetricalLogScale`.  These parameters are only used if
            *transform* is not set.
        subs : sequence of float, default: [1]
            The multiples of integer powers of the base where ticks are placed,
            i.e., ticks are placed at
            ``[sub * base**i for i in ... for sub in subs]``.

        Notes
        -----
        Either *transform*, or both *base* and *linthresh*, must be given.
