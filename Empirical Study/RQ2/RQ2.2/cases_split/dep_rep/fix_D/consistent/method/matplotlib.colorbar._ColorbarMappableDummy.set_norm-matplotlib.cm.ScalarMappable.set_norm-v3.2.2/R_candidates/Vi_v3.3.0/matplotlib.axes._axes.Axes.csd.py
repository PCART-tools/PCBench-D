        r"""
        Plot the cross-spectral density.

        The cross spectral density :math:`P_{xy}` by Welch's average
        periodogram method.  The vectors *x* and *y* are divided into
        *NFFT* length segments.  Each segment is detrended by function
        *detrend* and windowed by function *window*.  *noverlap* gives
        the length of the overlap between segments.  The product of
        the direct FFTs of *x* and *y* are averaged over each segment
        to compute :math:`P_{xy}`, with a scaling to correct for power
        loss due to windowing.

        If len(*x*) < *NFFT* or len(*y*) < *NFFT*, they will be zero
        padded to *NFFT*.

        Parameters
        ----------
        x, y : 1-D arrays or sequences
            Arrays or sequences containing the data.

        %(Spectral)s

        %(PSD)s

        noverlap : int, default: 0 (no overlap)
            The number of points of overlap between segments.

        Fc : int, default: 0
            The center frequency of *x*, which offsets the x extents of the
            plot to reflect the frequency range used when a signal is acquired
            and then filtered and downsampled to baseband.

        return_line : bool, default: False
            Whether to include the line object plotted in the returned values.

        Returns
        -------
        Pxy : 1-D array
            The values for the cross spectrum :math:`P_{xy}` before scaling
            (complex valued).

        freqs : 1-D array
            The frequencies corresponding to the elements in *Pxy*.

        line : `~matplotlib.lines.Line2D`
            The line created by this function.
            Only returned if *return_line* is True.

        Other Parameters
        ----------------
        **kwargs
            Keyword arguments control the `.Line2D` properties:

            %(_Line2D_docstr)s

        See Also
        --------
        psd : is equivalent to setting ``y = x``.

        Notes
        -----
        For plotting, the power is plotted as
        :math:`10 \log_{10}(P_{xy})` for decibels, though :math:`P_{xy}` itself
        is returned.
