        Construct a new scale.

        Notes
        -----
        The following note is for scale implementors.

        For back-compatibility reasons, scales take an `~matplotlib.axis.Axis`
        object as first argument.  However, this argument should not
        be used: a single scale object should be usable by multiple
        `~matplotlib.axis.Axis`\es at the same time.
