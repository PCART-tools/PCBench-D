    def dot(self, other):
        """
        Compute the dot product between the Series and the columns of other.

        This method computes the dot product between the Series and another
        one, or the Series and each columns of a DataFrame, or the Series and
        each columns of an array.

        It can also be called using `self @ other` in Python >= 3.5.

        Parameters
        ----------
        other : Series, DataFrame or array-like
            The other object to compute the dot product with its columns.

        Returns
        -------
        scalar, Series or numpy.ndarray
            Return the dot product of the Series and other if other is a
            Series, the Series of the dot product of Series and each rows of
            other if other is a DataFrame or a numpy.ndarray between the Series
            and each columns of the numpy array.

        See Also
        --------
        DataFrame.dot: Compute the matrix product with the DataFrame.
        Series.mul: Multiplication of series and other, element-wise.

        Notes
        -----
        The Series and other has to share the same index if other is a Series
        or a DataFrame.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> s = pd.Series([0, 1, 2, 3])
        >>> other = pd.Series([-1, 2, -3, 4])
        >>> s.dot(other)
        8
        >>> s @ other
        8
        >>> df = pd.DataFrame([[0, 1], [-2, 3], [4, -5], [6, 7]])
        >>> s.dot(df)
        0    24
        1    14
        dtype: int64
        >>> arr = np.array([[0, 1], [-2, 3], [4, -5], [6, 7]])
        >>> s.dot(arr)
        array([24, 14])
