        ----------
        mouseevent : `matplotlib.backend_bases.MouseEvent`

        Returns

        contains : bool
            Whether any values are within the radius.
        details : dict
            An artist-specific dictionary of details of the event context,
            such as which points are contained in the pick radius. See the
