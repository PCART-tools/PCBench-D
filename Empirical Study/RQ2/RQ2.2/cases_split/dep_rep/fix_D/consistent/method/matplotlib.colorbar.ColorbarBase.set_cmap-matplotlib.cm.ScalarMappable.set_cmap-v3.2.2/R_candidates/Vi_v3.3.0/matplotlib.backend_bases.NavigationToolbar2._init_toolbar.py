        This is where you actually build the GUI widgets (called by
        __init__).  The icons ``home.xpm``, ``back.xpm``, ``forward.xpm``,
        ``hand.xpm``, ``zoom_to_rect.xpm`` and ``filesave.xpm`` are standard
        across backends (there are ppm versions in CVS also).

        You just need to set the callbacks

        home         : self.home
        back         : self.back
        forward      : self.forward
        hand         : self.pan
        zoom_to_rect : self.zoom
        filesave     : self.save_figure

        You only need to define the last one - the others are in the base
        class implementation.
