    def legend(self, *args, **kwargs):
        """
        Place a legend on the axes.

        Call signatures::

            legend()
            legend(labels)
            legend(handles, labels)

        The call signatures correspond to three different ways how to use
        this method.

        **1. Automatic detection of elements to be shown in the legend**

        The elements to be added to the legend are automatically determined,
        when you do not pass in any extra arguments.

        In this case, the labels are taken from the artist. You can specify
        them either at artist creation or by calling the
        :meth:`~.Artist.set_label` method on the artist::

            line, = ax.plot([1, 2, 3], label='Inline label')
            ax.legend()

        or::

            line, = ax.plot([1, 2, 3])
            line.set_label('Label via method')
            ax.legend()

        Specific lines can be excluded from the automatic legend element
        selection by defining a label starting with an underscore.
        This is default for all artists, so calling `.Axes.legend` without
        any arguments and without setting the labels manually will result in
        no legend being drawn.


        **2. Labeling existing plot elements**

        To make a legend for lines which already exist on the axes
        (via plot for instance), simply call this function with an iterable
        of strings, one for each legend item. For example::

            ax.plot([1, 2, 3])
            ax.legend(['A simple line'])

        Note: This way of using is discouraged, because the relation between
        plot elements and labels is only implicit by their order and can
        easily be mixed up.


        **3. Explicitly defining the elements in the legend**

        For full control of which artists have a legend entry, it is possible
        to pass an iterable of legend artists followed by an iterable of
        legend labels respectively::

            legend((line1, line2, line3), ('label1', 'label2', 'label3'))

        Parameters
        ----------
        handles : sequence of `.Artist`, optional
            A list of Artists (lines, patches) to be added to the legend.
            Use this together with *labels*, if you need full control on what
            is shown in the legend and the automatic mechanism described above
            is not sufficient.

            The length of handles and labels should be the same in this
            case. If they are not, they are truncated to the smaller length.

        labels : list of str, optional
            A list of labels to show next to the artists.
            Use this together with *handles*, if you need full control on what
            is shown in the legend and the automatic mechanism described above
            is not sufficient.

        Returns
        -------
        `~matplotlib.legend.Legend`

        Other Parameters
        ----------------
        %(_legend_kw_doc)s

        Notes
        -----
        Some artists are not supported by this function.  See
        :doc:`/tutorials/intermediate/legend_guide` for details.
