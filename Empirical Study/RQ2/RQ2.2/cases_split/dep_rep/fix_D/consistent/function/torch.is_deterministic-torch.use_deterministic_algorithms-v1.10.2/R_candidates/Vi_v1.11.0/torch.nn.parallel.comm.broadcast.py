def broadcast(tensor, devices=None, *, out=None):
    r"""Broadcasts a tensor to specified GPU devices.

    Args:
        tensor (Tensor): tensor to broadcast. Can be on CPU or GPU.
        devices (Iterable[torch.device, str or int], optional): an iterable of
          GPU devices, among which to broadcast.
        out (Sequence[Tensor], optional, keyword-only): the GPU tensors to
          store output results.

    .. note::
        Exactly one of :attr:`devices` and :attr:`out` must be specified.

    Returns:
        - If :attr:`devices` is specified,
            a tuple containing copies of :attr:`tensor`, placed on
            :attr:`devices`.
        - If :attr:`out` is specified,
            a tuple containing :attr:`out` tensors, each containing a copy of
            :attr:`tensor`.
