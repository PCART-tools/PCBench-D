def _get_overloaded_args(relevant_args: Iterable[Any]) -> List[Any]:
    """Returns a list of arguments on which to call __torch_function__.

    Checks arguments in relevant_args for __torch_function__ implementations,
    storing references to the arguments and their types in overloaded_args and
    overloaded_types in order of calling precedence. Only distinct types are
    considered. If a type is a subclass of another type it will have higher
    precedence, otherwise the precedence order is the same as the order of
    arguments in relevant_args, that is, from left-to-right in the argument list.

    The precedence-determining algorithm implemented in this function is
    described in `NEP-0018`_.

    See torch::append_overloaded_arg for the equivalent function in the C++
    implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    relevant_args : iterable of array-like
        Iterable of array-like arguments to check for __torch_function__
        methods.

    Returns
    -------
    overloaded_args : list
        Arguments from relevant_args on which to call __torch_function__
        methods, in the order in which they should be called.
