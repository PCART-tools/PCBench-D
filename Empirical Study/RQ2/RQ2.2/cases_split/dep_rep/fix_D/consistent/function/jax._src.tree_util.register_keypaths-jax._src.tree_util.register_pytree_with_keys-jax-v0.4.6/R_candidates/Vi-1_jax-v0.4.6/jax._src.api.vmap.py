  """Vectorizing map. Creates a function which maps ``fun`` over argument axes.

  Args:
    fun: Function to be mapped over additional axes.
    in_axes: An integer, None, or (nested) standard Python container
      (tuple/list/dict) thereof specifying which input array axes to map over.

      If each positional argument to ``fun`` is an array, then ``in_axes`` can
      be an integer, a None, or a tuple of integers and Nones with length equal
      to the number of positional arguments to ``fun``. An integer or ``None``
      indicates which array axis to map over for all arguments (with ``None``
      indicating not to map any axis), and a tuple indicates which axis to map
      for each corresponding positional argument. Axis integers must be in the
      range ``[-ndim, ndim)`` for each array, where ``ndim`` is the number of
      dimensions (axes) of the corresponding input array.

      If the positional arguments to ``fun`` are container (pytree) types, the
      corresponding element of ``in_axes`` can itself be a matching container,
      so that distinct array axes can be mapped for different container
      elements. ``in_axes`` must be a container tree prefix of the positional
      argument tuple passed to ``fun``. See this link for more detail:
      https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pytrees.html#applying-optional-parameters-to-pytrees

      Either ``axis_size`` must be provided explicitly, or at least one
      positional argument must have ``in_axes`` not None. The sizes of the
      mapped input axes for all mapped positional arguments must all be equal.

      Arguments passed as keywords are always mapped over their leading axis
      (i.e. axis index 0).

      See below for examples.

    out_axes: An integer, None, or (nested) standard Python container
      (tuple/list/dict) thereof indicating where the mapped axis should appear
      in the output. All outputs with a mapped axis must have a non-None
      ``out_axes`` specification. Axis integers must be in the range ``[-ndim,
      ndim)`` for each output array, where ``ndim`` is the number of dimensions
      (axes) of the array returned by the :func:`vmap`-ed function, which is one
      more than the number of dimensions (axes) of the corresponding array
      returned by ``fun``.
    axis_name: Optional, a hashable Python object used to identify the mapped
      axis so that parallel collectives can be applied.
    axis_size: Optional, an integer indicating the size of the axis to be
      mapped. If not provided, the mapped axis size is inferred from arguments.

  Returns:
    Batched/vectorized version of ``fun`` with arguments that correspond to
    those of ``fun``, but with extra array axes at positions indicated by
    ``in_axes``, and a return value that corresponds to that of ``fun``, but
    with extra array axes at positions indicated by ``out_axes``.

  For example, we can implement a matrix-matrix product using a vector dot
  product:

  >>> import jax.numpy as jnp
  >>>
  >>> vv = lambda x, y: jnp.vdot(x, y)  #  ([a], [a]) -> []
  >>> mv = vmap(vv, (0, None), 0)      #  ([b,a], [a]) -> [b]      (b is the mapped axis)
  >>> mm = vmap(mv, (None, 1), 1)      #  ([b,a], [a,c]) -> [b,c]  (c is the mapped axis)

  Here we use ``[a,b]`` to indicate an array with shape (a,b). Here are some
  variants:

  >>> mv1 = vmap(vv, (0, 0), 0)   #  ([b,a], [b,a]) -> [b]        (b is the mapped axis)
  >>> mv2 = vmap(vv, (0, 1), 0)   #  ([b,a], [a,b]) -> [b]        (b is the mapped axis)
  >>> mm2 = vmap(mv2, (1, 1), 0)  #  ([b,c,a], [a,c,b]) -> [c,b]  (c is the mapped axis)

  Here's an example of using container types in ``in_axes`` to specify which
  axes of the container elements to map over:

  >>> A, B, C, D = 2, 3, 4, 5
  >>> x = jnp.ones((A, B))
  >>> y = jnp.ones((B, C))
  >>> z = jnp.ones((C, D))
  >>> def foo(tree_arg):
  ...   x, (y, z) = tree_arg
  ...   return jnp.dot(x, jnp.dot(y, z))
  >>> tree = (x, (y, z))
  >>> print(foo(tree))
  [[12. 12. 12. 12. 12.]
   [12. 12. 12. 12. 12.]]
  >>> from jax import vmap
  >>> K = 6  # batch size
  >>> x = jnp.ones((K, A, B))  # batch axis in different locations
  >>> y = jnp.ones((B, K, C))
  >>> z = jnp.ones((C, D, K))
  >>> tree = (x, (y, z))
  >>> vfoo = vmap(foo, in_axes=((0, (1, 2)),))
  >>> print(vfoo(tree).shape)
  (6, 2, 5)

  Here's another example using container types in ``in_axes``, this time a
  dictionary, to specify the elements of the container to map over:

  >>> dct = {'a': 0., 'b': jnp.arange(5.)}
  >>> x = 1.
  >>> def foo(dct, x):
  ...  return dct['a'] + dct['b'] + x
  >>> out = vmap(foo, in_axes=({'a': None, 'b': 0}, None))(dct, x)
  >>> print(out)
  [1. 2. 3. 4. 5.]

  The results of a vectorized function can be mapped or unmapped. For example,
  the function below returns a pair with the first element mapped and the second
  unmapped. Only for unmapped results we can specify ``out_axes`` to be ``None``
  (to keep it unmapped).

  >>> print(vmap(lambda x, y: (x + y, y * 2.), in_axes=(0, None), out_axes=(0, None))(jnp.arange(2.), 4.))
  (Array([4., 5.], dtype=float32), 8.0)

  If the ``out_axes`` is specified for an unmapped result, the result is
  broadcast across the mapped axis:

  >>> print(vmap(lambda x, y: (x + y, y * 2.), in_axes=(0, None), out_axes=0)(jnp.arange(2.), 4.))
  (Array([4., 5.], dtype=float32), Array([8., 8.], dtype=float32, weak_type=True))

  If the ``out_axes`` is specified for a mapped result, the result is transposed
  accordingly.

  Finally, here's an example using ``axis_name`` together with collectives:

  >>> xs = jnp.arange(3. * 4.).reshape(3, 4)
  >>> print(vmap(lambda x: lax.psum(x, 'i'), axis_name='i')(xs))
  [[12. 15. 18. 21.]
   [12. 15. 18. 21.]
   [12. 15. 18. 21.]]

  See the :py:func:`jax.pmap` docstring for more examples involving collectives.
