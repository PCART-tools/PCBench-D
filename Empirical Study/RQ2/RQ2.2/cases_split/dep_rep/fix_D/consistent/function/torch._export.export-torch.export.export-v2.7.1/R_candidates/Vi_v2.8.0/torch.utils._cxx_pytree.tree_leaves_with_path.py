    Args:
        tree: a pytree. If it contains a custom type, that type must be
            registered with an appropriate `tree_flatten_with_path_fn` when registered
            with :func:`register_pytree_node`.
        is_leaf: An extra leaf predicate function that will be called at each
            flattening step. The function should have a single argument with signature
            ``is_leaf(node) -> bool``. If it returns :data:`True`, the whole subtree being treated
            as a leaf. Otherwise, the default pytree registry will be used to determine a node is a
            leaf or not. If the function is not specified, the default pytree registry will be used.
    Returns:
        A list of (key path, leaf) pairs.
