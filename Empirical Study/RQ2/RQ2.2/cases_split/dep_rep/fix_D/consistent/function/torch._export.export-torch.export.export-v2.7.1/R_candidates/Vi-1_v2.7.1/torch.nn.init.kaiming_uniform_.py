    r"""Fill the input `Tensor` with values using a Kaiming uniform distribution.

    The method is described in `Delving deep into rectifiers: Surpassing
    human-level performance on ImageNet classification` - He, K. et al. (2015).
    The resulting tensor will have values sampled from
    :math:`\mathcal{U}(-\text{bound}, \text{bound})` where

    .. math::
        \text{bound} = \text{gain} \times \sqrt{\frac{3}{\text{fan\_mode}}}

    Also known as He initialization.

    Args:
        tensor: an n-dimensional `torch.Tensor`
        a: the negative slope of the rectifier used after this layer (only
            used with ``'leaky_relu'``)
        mode: either ``'fan_in'`` (default) or ``'fan_out'``. Choosing ``'fan_in'``
            preserves the magnitude of the variance of the weights in the
            forward pass. Choosing ``'fan_out'`` preserves the magnitudes in the
            backwards pass.
        nonlinearity: the non-linear function (`nn.functional` name),
            recommended to use only with ``'relu'`` or ``'leaky_relu'`` (default).
        generator: the torch Generator to sample from (default: None)

    Examples:
        >>> w = torch.empty(3, 5)
        >>> nn.init.kaiming_uniform_(w, mode='fan_in', nonlinearity='relu')

    Note:
        Be aware that ``fan_in`` and ``fan_out`` are calculated assuming
        that the weight matrix is used in a transposed manner,
        (i.e., ``x @ w.T`` in ``Linear`` layers, where ``w.shape = [fan_out, fan_in]``).
        This is important for correct initialization.
        If you plan to use ``x @ w``, where ``w.shape = [fan_in, fan_out]``,
        pass in a transposed weight matrix, i.e. ``nn.init.kaiming_uniform_(w.T, ...)``.
