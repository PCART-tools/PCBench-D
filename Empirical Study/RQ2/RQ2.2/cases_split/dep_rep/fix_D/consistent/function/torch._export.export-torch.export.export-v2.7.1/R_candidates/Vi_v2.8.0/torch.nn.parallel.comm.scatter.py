    """Scatters tensor across multiple GPUs.

    Args:
        tensor (Tensor): tensor to scatter. Can be on CPU or GPU.
        devices (Iterable[torch.device, str or int], optional): an iterable of
          GPU devices, among which to scatter.
        chunk_sizes (Iterable[int], optional): sizes of chunks to be placed on
          each device. It should match :attr:`devices` in length and sums to
          ``tensor.size(dim)``. If not specified, :attr:`tensor` will be divided
          into equal chunks.
        dim (int, optional): A dimension along which to chunk :attr:`tensor`.
          Default: ``0``.
        streams (Iterable[torch.cuda.Stream], optional): an iterable of Streams, among
          which to execute the scatter. If not specified, the default stream will
          be utilized.
        out (Sequence[Tensor], optional, keyword-only): the GPU tensors to
          store output results. Sizes of these tensors must match that of
          :attr:`tensor`, except for :attr:`dim`, where the total size must
          sum to ``tensor.size(dim)``.

    .. note::
        Exactly one of :attr:`devices` and :attr:`out` must be specified. When
        :attr:`out` is specified, :attr:`chunk_sizes` must not be specified and
        will be inferred from sizes of :attr:`out`.

    Returns:
        - If :attr:`devices` is specified,
            a tuple containing chunks of :attr:`tensor`, placed on
            :attr:`devices`.
        - If :attr:`out` is specified,
            a tuple containing :attr:`out` tensors, each containing a chunk of
            :attr:`tensor`.
