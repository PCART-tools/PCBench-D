    Broadcast two TensorRT tensors to the same number of dimensions by
    prepending 1s to the tensor with less number of dimensions.

    Args:
        network (TRTNetwork): TensorRT network object.
        a (TRTTensor): A TensorRT ITensor.
        b (TRTTensor): A TensorRT ITensor.
        a_name (str): Name of tensor a.
        b_name (str): Name of tensor b.
        preset_diff (int): The difference of number of dimensions after broadcast.
            A positive number means after broadcast, tensor `a` would have `preset_diff`
            more dimensions than `b`. This is used in matmul, since we need to broadcast
            tensors but not always to the same number of dimension. The reason is that
            matmul supports Matrix x Vector and in this case broadcasted vector should
            have 1 less number of dimensions than the matrix tensor.

    Returns:
        Two TensorRT ITensors that are broadcasted to the same number of dimensions.
