    """
    Mark a tensor as having a dynamic dim and set corresponding min and max range for the dim.

    [Note - on the state of mark_dynamic]

    The behavior of having a dynamic dimension on a tensor is governed by a few factors:

    1) torch._dynamo.config dynamic_shapes True or False.
        a) dynamic_shapes=True - dynamic_shapes must be True for mark_dynamic to work.
        a) dynamic_shapes=False - This config will raise an exception when used in conjunction with
        mark_dynamic. We will eventually support this.

    2) If the dimension is fully constrained - as in, it does not allow more than a single value
    in both eager (torch.compile, torch._dynamo.optimize) mode and export mode (torch._dynamo.export),
    we will raise an error

    3) If the dimension is partially constrained - allowing at least 2 values but not the full unbounded
    range of shapes, in eager we will pass it through, but export will raise an error.

    4) Attempts to trace this function will explicitly raise. As such, all calls to mark_dynamic must be made
    before torch.compile.
