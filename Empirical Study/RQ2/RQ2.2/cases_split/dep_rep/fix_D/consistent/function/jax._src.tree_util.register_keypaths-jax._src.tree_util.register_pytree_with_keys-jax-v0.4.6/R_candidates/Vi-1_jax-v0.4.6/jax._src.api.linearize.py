def linearize(fun: Callable, *primals) -> Tuple[Any, Callable]:
  """Produces a linear approximation to ``fun`` using :py:func:`jvp` and partial eval.

  Args:
    fun: Function to be differentiated. Its arguments should be arrays, scalars,
      or standard Python containers of arrays or scalars. It should return an
      array, scalar, or standard python container of arrays or scalars.
    primals: The primal values at which the Jacobian of ``fun`` should be
      evaluated. Should be a tuple of arrays, scalar, or standard Python
      container thereof. The length of the tuple is equal to the number of
      positional parameters of ``fun``.

  Returns:
    A pair where the first element is the value of ``f(*primals)`` and the
    second element is a function that evaluates the (forward-mode)
    Jacobian-vector product of ``fun`` evaluated at ``primals`` without re-doing
    the linearization work.

  In terms of values computed, :py:func:`linearize` behaves much like a curried
  :py:func:`jvp`, where these two code blocks compute the same values::

    y, out_tangent = jax.jvp(f, (x,), (in_tangent,))

    y, f_jvp = jax.linearize(f, x)
    out_tangent = f_jvp(in_tangent)

  However, the difference is that :py:func:`linearize` uses partial evaluation
  so that the function ``f`` is not re-linearized on calls to ``f_jvp``. In
  general that means the memory usage scales with the size of the computation,
  much like in reverse-mode. (Indeed, :py:func:`linearize` has a similar
  signature to :py:func:`vjp`!)

  This function is mainly useful if you want to apply ``f_jvp`` multiple times,
  i.e. to evaluate a pushforward for many different input tangent vectors at the
  same linearization point. Moreover if all the input tangent vectors are known
  at once, it can be more efficient to vectorize using :py:func:`vmap`, as in::

    pushfwd = partial(jvp, f, (x,))
    y, out_tangents = vmap(pushfwd, out_axes=(None, 0))((in_tangents,))

  By using :py:func:`vmap` and :py:func:`jvp` together like this we avoid the stored-linearization
  memory cost that scales with the depth of the computation, which is incurred
  by both :py:func:`linearize` and :py:func:`vjp`.

  Here's a more complete example of using :py:func:`linearize`:

  >>> import jax
  >>> import jax.numpy as jnp
  >>>
  >>> def f(x): return 3. * jnp.sin(x) + jnp.cos(x / 2.)
  ...
  >>> jax.jvp(f, (2.,), (3.,))
  (Array(3.26819, dtype=float32, weak_type=True), Array(-5.00753, dtype=float32, weak_type=True))
  >>> y, f_jvp = jax.linearize(f, 2.)
  >>> print(y)
  3.2681944
  >>> print(f_jvp(3.))
  -5.007528
  >>> print(f_jvp(4.))
  -6.676704
