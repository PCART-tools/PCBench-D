    Standing for the Jacobian-vector product, returns a tuple containing
    the output of `func(*primals)` and the "Jacobian of ``func`` evaluated at
    ``primals``" times ``tangents``. This is also known as forward-mode autodiff.

    Args:
        func (function): A Python function that takes one or more arguments,
            one of which must be a Tensor, and returns one or more Tensors
        primals (Tensors): Positional arguments to ``func`` that must all be
            Tensors. The returned function will also be computing the
            derivative with respect to these arguments
        tangents (Tensors): The "vector" for which Jacobian-vector-product is
            computed. Must be the same structure and sizes as the inputs to
            ``func``.
        has_aux (bool): Flag indicating that ``func`` returns a
            ``(output, aux)`` tuple where the first element is the output of
            the function to be differentiated and the second element is
            other auxiliary objects that will not be differentiated.
            Default: False.

    Returns:
        Returns a ``(output, jvp_out)`` tuple containing the output of ``func``
        evaluated at ``primals`` and the Jacobian-vector product.
        If ``has_aux is True``, then instead returns a ``(output, jvp_out, aux)`` tuple.

    .. note::
        You may see this API error out with "forward-mode AD not implemented
        for operator X". If so, please file a bug report and we will prioritize it.

    jvp is useful when you wish to compute gradients of a function R^1 -> R^N

        >>> from torch.func import jvp
        >>> x = torch.randn([])
        >>> f = lambda x: x * torch.tensor([1., 2., 3])
        >>> value, grad = jvp(f, (x,), (torch.tensor(1.),))
        >>> assert torch.allclose(value, f(x))
        >>> assert torch.allclose(grad, torch.tensor([1., 2, 3]))

    :func:`jvp` can support functions with multiple inputs by passing in the
    tangents for each of the inputs

         >>> from torch.func import jvp
         >>> x = torch.randn(5)
         >>> y = torch.randn(5)
         >>> f = lambda x, y: (x * y)
         >>> _, output = jvp(f, (x, y), (torch.ones(5), torch.ones(5)))
         >>> assert torch.allclose(output, x + y)
