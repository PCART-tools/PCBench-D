def broadcast_tensors(*tensors):
    r"""broadcast_tensors(*tensors) -> List of Tensors

    Broadcasts the given tensors according to :ref:`broadcasting-semantics`.

    Args:
        *tensors: any number of tensors of the same type

    .. warning::

        More than one element of a broadcasted tensor may refer to a single
        memory location. As a result, in-place operations (especially ones that
        are vectorized) may result in incorrect behavior. If you need to write
        to the tensors, please clone them first.

    Example::

        >>> x = torch.arange(3).view(1, 3)
        >>> y = torch.arange(2).view(2, 1)
        >>> a, b = torch.broadcast_tensors(x, y)
        >>> a.size()
        torch.Size([2, 3])
        >>> a
        tensor([[0, 1, 2],
                [0, 1, 2]])
    """
    # This wrapper exists to support variadic args.
    if has_torch_function(tensors):
        return handle_torch_function(broadcast_tensors, tensors, *tensors)
    return _VF.broadcast_tensors(tensors)  # type: ignore[attr-defined]
