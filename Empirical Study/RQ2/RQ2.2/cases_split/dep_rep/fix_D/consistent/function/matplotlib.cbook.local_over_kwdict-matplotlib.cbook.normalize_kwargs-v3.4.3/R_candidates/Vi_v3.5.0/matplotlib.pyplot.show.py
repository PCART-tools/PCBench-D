def show(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    Display all open figures.

    Parameters
    ----------
    block : bool, optional
        Whether to wait for all figures to be closed before returning.

        If `True` block and run the GUI main loop until all figure windows
        are closed.

        If `False` ensure that all figure windows are displayed and return
        immediately.  In this case, you are responsible for ensuring
        that the event loop is running to have responsive figures.

        Defaults to True in non-interactive mode and to False in interactive
        mode (see `.pyplot.isinteractive`).

    See Also
    --------
    ion : Enable interactive mode, which shows / updates the figure after
          every plotting command, so that calling ``show()`` is not necessary.
    ioff : Disable interactive mode.
    savefig : Save the figure to an image file instead of showing it on screen.

    Notes
    -----
    **Saving figures to file and showing a window at the same time**

    If you want an image file as well as a user interface window, use
    `.pyplot.savefig` before `.pyplot.show`. At the end of (a blocking)
    ``show()`` the figure is closed and thus unregistered from pyplot. Calling
    `.pyplot.savefig` afterwards would save a new and thus empty figure. This
    limitation of command order does not apply if the show is non-blocking or
    if you keep a reference to the figure and use `.Figure.savefig`.

    **Auto-show in jupyter notebooks**

    The jupyter backends (activated via ``%matplotlib inline``,
    ``%matplotlib notebook``, or ``%matplotlib widget``), call ``show()`` at
    the end of every cell by default. Thus, you usually don't have to call it
    explicitly there.
