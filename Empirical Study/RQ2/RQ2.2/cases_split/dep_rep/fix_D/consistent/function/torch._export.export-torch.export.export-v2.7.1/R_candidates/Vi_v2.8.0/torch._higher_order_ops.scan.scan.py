    Performs an inclusive scan with a combine function.

    .. warning::
        `torch.scan` is a prototype feature in PyTorch. It currently
        does not support autograd and you may run into miscompiles.

    Args:
        combine_fn (Callable): A binary callable with type ``(Tensor, Tensor) -> (Tensor, Tensor)``,
            or if xs is a pytree ``(pytree, pytree) -> (pytree, pytree)``.
            The first input to ``combine_fn`` is the previous or initial scan carry
            and the second input element to ``combine_fn`` is a slice of the input along dim.
            The first output element of ``combine_fn`` is the next scan carry
            and the second output  of ``combine_fn`` represents a slice of the output.
            This function must be pure, i.e., no lifted arguments are supported at the moment
            and may not have any side effects.
        init (torch.Tensor or pytree with tensor leaves): The inital scan carry, a tensor, or nested pytree of tensors.
            The ``init`` is expected to have the same pytree structure as the first output element (i.e. carry)
            of ``combine_fn``.
        xs (torch.Tensor or pytree with tensor leaves): The input tensor, or nested pytree of tensors.

    Kwargs:
        dim (int): the dimension to scan over, default 0.
        reverse (bool): A boolean stating if the scan should be reversed with respect to ``dim``, default ``False``.

    Returns:
        final_carry (torch.Tensor or pytree with tensor leaves),
            the final carry of the scan operation with same pytree structure as init.
        out (torch.Tensor or pytree with tensor leaves),
            each tensor leaf is a stacked output along first dim, where each slice is the output of a scan iteration.

    Restrictions:
        - The combine_fn shouldn't have any aliasing between input-input, input-output, and output-output. E.g. return a view
            or the same tensor as input is not supported. As a workaround, can clone the output to avoid aliasing.

        - The combine_fn shoudn't mutate any inputs. We'll remove the mutation restriction for inference soon. Please file an issue
            if you input mutation support for training is needed.

        - The combine_fn's init carry should match the next_carry in pytree structure and in tensor metadata.

    Example::

        def add(x: torch.Tensor, y: torch.Tensor):
            next_carry = y = x + y
            # clone the output to avoid output-output aliasing
            return next_carry, y.clone()

        i0 = torch.zeros(1)
        xs = torch.arange(5)
        # returns torch.tensor([10.]), torch.tensor([[0], [1.], [3.], [6.], [10.]])
        last_carry, cumsum = scan(add, init=i0, xs=xs)
