    """
    Entry-point function to handle the logic of row-wise sharding of weight
    for embedding. (Detailed explanations of the logic can be found in
    the comment for sharded_embedding.)

    Args:
        input: list of ID used for lookup and aggregation.
        world_size: number of ranks.
        weight: sharded weight tensor.
        local_shard: row-wise shared local weight used for lookup.
        max_norm: If given, each embedding vector with norm larger
            than max_norm is renormalized to have norm max_norm.
            Note: this will modify weight in-place.
        norm_type: The p in the p-norm to compute for the max_norm option.
        padding_idx: If specified, the entries at padding_idx do
            not contribute to the gradient; therefore, the embedding
            vector at padding_idx is not updated during training,
            i.e. it remains as a fixed "pad".
        rank: # of cuda process.
        pg: process group.

    Returns: final result of lookup.
