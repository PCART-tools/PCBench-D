def delayed(obj, name=None, pure=False, nout=None, traverse=True):
    """Wraps a function or object to produce a ``Delayed``.

    ``Delayed`` objects act as proxies for the object they wrap, but all
    operations on them are done lazily by building up a dask graph internally.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obj : object
        The function or object to wrap
    name : string or hashable, optional
        The key to use in the underlying graph for the wrapped object. Defaults
        to hashing content.
    pure : bool, optional
        Indicates whether calling the resulting ``Delayed`` object is a pure
        operation. If True, arguments to the call are hashed to produce
        deterministic keys. Default is False.
    nout : int, optional
        The number of outputs returned from calling the resulting ``Delayed``
        object. If provided, the ``Delayed`` output of the call can be iterated
        into ``nout`` objects, allowing for unpacking of results. By default
        iteration over ``Delayed`` objects will error. Note, that ``nout=1``
        expects ``obj``, to return a tuple of length 1, and consequently for
        `nout=0``, ``obj`` should return an empty tuple.
    traverse : bool, optional
        By default dask traverses builtin python collections looking for dask
        objects passed to ``delayed``. For large collections this can be
        expensive. If ``obj`` doesn't contain any dask objects, set
        ``traverse=False`` to avoid doing this traversal.

    Examples
    --------
    Apply to functions to delay execution:

    >>> def inc(x):
    ...     return x + 1

    >>> inc(10)
    11

    >>> x = delayed(inc, pure=True)(10)
    >>> type(x) == Delayed
    True
    >>> x.compute()
    11

    Can be used as a decorator:

    >>> @delayed(pure=True)
    ... def add(a, b):
    ...     return a + b
    >>> add(1, 2).compute()
    3

    ``delayed`` also accepts an optional keyword ``pure``. If False (default),
    then subsequent calls will always produce a different ``Delayed``. This is
    useful for non-pure functions (such as ``time`` or ``random``).

    >>> from random import random
    >>> out1 = delayed(random, pure=False)()
    >>> out2 = delayed(random, pure=False)()
    >>> out1.key == out2.key
    False

    If you know a function is pure (output only depends on the input, with no
    global state), then you can set ``pure=True``. This will attempt to apply a
    consistent name to the output, but will fallback on the same behavior of
    ``pure=False`` if this fails.

    >>> @delayed(pure=True)
    ... def add(a, b):
    ...     return a + b
    >>> out1 = add(1, 2)
    >>> out2 = add(1, 2)
    >>> out1.key == out2.key
    True

    The key name of the result of calling a delayed object is determined by
    hashing the arguments by default. To explicitly set the name, you can use
    the ``dask_key_name`` keyword when calling the function:

    >>> add(1, 2)    # doctest: +SKIP
    Delayed('add-3dce7c56edd1ac2614add714086e950f')
    >>> add(1, 2, dask_key_name='three')
    Delayed('three')

    Note that objects with the same key name are assumed to have the same
    result. If you set the names explicitly you should make sure your key names
    are different for different results.

    >>> add(1, 2, dask_key_name='three')
    >>> add(2, 1, dask_key_name='three')
    >>> add(2, 2, dask_key_name='four')

    ``delayed`` can also be applied to objects to make operations on them lazy:

    >>> a = delayed([1, 2, 3])
    >>> isinstance(a, Delayed)
    True
    >>> a.compute()
    [1, 2, 3]

    The key name of a delayed object is hashed by default if ``pure=True`` or
    is generated randomly if ``pure=False`` (default).  To explicitly set the
    name, you can use the ``name`` keyword:

    >>> a = delayed([1, 2, 3], name='mylist')
    >>> a
    Delayed('mylist')

    Delayed results act as a proxy to the underlying object. Many operators
    are supported:

    >>> (a + [1, 2]).compute()
    [1, 2, 3, 1, 2]
    >>> a[1].compute()
    2

    Method and attribute access also works:

    >>> a.count(2).compute()
    1

    Note that if a method doesn't exist, no error will be thrown until runtime:

    >>> res = a.not_a_real_method()
    >>> res.compute()  # doctest: +SKIP
    AttributeError("'list' object has no attribute 'not_a_real_method'")

    Methods are assumed to be impure by default, meaning that subsequent calls
    may return different results. To assume purity, set `pure=True`. This
    allows sharing of any intermediate values.

    >>> a.count(2, pure=True).key == a.count(2, pure=True).key
    True

    As with function calls, method calls also support the ``dask_key_name``
    keyword:

    >>> a.count(2, dask_key_name="count_2")
    Delayed("count_2")
