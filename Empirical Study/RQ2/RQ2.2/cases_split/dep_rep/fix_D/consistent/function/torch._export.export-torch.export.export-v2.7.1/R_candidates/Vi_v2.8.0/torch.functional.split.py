def split(

    dim: int = 0,
) -> tuple[Tensor, ...]:
    r"""Splits the tensor into chunks. Each chunk is a view of the original tensor.

    If :attr:`split_size_or_sections` is an integer type, then :attr:`tensor` will
    be split into equally sized chunks (if possible). Last chunk will be smaller if
    the tensor size along the given dimension :attr:`dim` is not divisible by
    :attr:`split_size`.

    If :attr:`split_size_or_sections` is a list, then :attr:`tensor` will be split
    into ``len(split_size_or_sections)`` chunks with sizes in :attr:`dim` according
    to :attr:`split_size_or_sections`.

    Args:
        tensor (Tensor): tensor to split.
        split_size_or_sections (int) or (list(int)): size of a single chunk or
            list of sizes for each chunk
        dim (int): dimension along which to split the tensor.

    Example::

        >>> a = torch.arange(10).reshape(5, 2)
        >>> a
        tensor([[0, 1],
                [2, 3],
