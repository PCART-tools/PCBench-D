def use_deterministic_algorithms(mode, *, warn_only=False):
    r""" Sets whether PyTorch operations must use "deterministic"
    algorithms. That is, algorithms which, given the same input, and when
    run on the same software and hardware, always produce the same output.
    When enabled, operations will use deterministic algorithms when available,
    and if only nondeterministic algorithms are available they will throw a
    :class:`RuntimeError` when called.

    .. note:: :func:`torch.set_deterministic_debug_mode` offers an alternative
        interface for this feature.

    The following normally-nondeterministic operations will act
    deterministically when ``mode=True``:

        * :class:`torch.nn.Conv1d` when called on CUDA tensor
        * :class:`torch.nn.Conv2d` when called on CUDA tensor
        * :class:`torch.nn.Conv3d` when called on CUDA tensor
        * :class:`torch.nn.ConvTranspose1d` when called on CUDA tensor
        * :class:`torch.nn.ConvTranspose2d` when called on CUDA tensor
        * :class:`torch.nn.ConvTranspose3d` when called on CUDA tensor
        * :func:`torch.bmm` when called on sparse-dense CUDA tensors
        * :func:`torch.Tensor.__getitem__` when attempting to differentiate a CPU tensor
          and the index is a list of tensors
        * :func:`torch.Tensor.index_put` with ``accumulate=False``
        * :func:`torch.Tensor.index_put` with ``accumulate=True`` when called on a CPU
          tensor
        * :func:`torch.Tensor.put_` with ``accumulate=True`` when called on a CPU
          tensor
        * :func:`torch.Tensor.scatter_add_` when ``input`` dimension is one and called
          on a CUDA tensor
        * :func:`torch.gather` when ``input`` dimension is one and called
          on a CUDA tensor that requires grad
        * :func:`torch.index_add` when called on CUDA tensor
        * :func:`torch.index_select` when attempting to differentiate a CUDA tensor
        * :func:`torch.repeat_interleave` when attempting to differentiate a CUDA tensor
        * :func:`torch.Tensor.index_copy` when called on a CPU or CUDA tensor

        * :func:`torch.nn.functional.interpolate` when attempting to differentiate a CUDA tensor
          and one of the following modes is used:

          - ``linear``
          - ``bilinear``
          - ``bicubic``
          - ``trilinear``

        * :class:`torch.nn.ReflectionPad1d` when attempting to differentiate a CUDA tensor
        * :class:`torch.nn.ReflectionPad2d` when attempting to differentiate a CUDA tensor

    A handful of CUDA operations are nondeterministic if the CUDA version is
    10.2 or greater, unless the environment variable ``CUBLAS_WORKSPACE_CONFIG=:4096:8``
    or ``CUBLAS_WORKSPACE_CONFIG=:16:8`` is set. See the CUDA documentation for more
    details: `<https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cublas/index.html#cublasApi_reproducibility>`_
    If one of these environment variable configurations is not set, a :class:`RuntimeError`
    will be raised from these operations when called with CUDA tensors:

        * :func:`torch.mm`
        * :func:`torch.mv`
        * :func:`torch.bmm`

    Note that deterministic operations tend to have worse performance than
    nondeterministic operations.

    .. note::

        This flag does not detect or prevent nondeterministic behavior caused
        by calling an inplace operation on a tensor with an internal memory
        overlap or by giving such a tensor as the :attr:`out` argument for an
        operation. In these cases, multiple writes of different data may target
        a single memory location, and the order of writes is not guaranteed.

    Args:
        mode (:class:`bool`): If True, makes potentially nondeterministic
            operations switch to a deterministic algorithm or throw a runtime
            error. If False, allows nondeterministic operations.

    Keyword args:
        warn_only (:class:`bool`, optional): If True, operations that do not
            have a deterministic implementation will throw a warning instead of
            an error. Default: ``False``

    Example::

        >>> torch.use_deterministic_algorithms(True)

        # Forward mode nondeterministic error
        >>> torch.randn(10).index_copy(0, torch.tensor([0]), torch.randn(1))
        ...
        RuntimeError: index_copy does not have a deterministic implementation...

        # Backward mode nondeterministic error
        >>> torch.randn(10, requires_grad=True, device='cuda').index_select(0, torch.tensor([0], device='cuda')).backward()
        ...
        RuntimeError: index_add_cuda_ does not have a deterministic implementation...
