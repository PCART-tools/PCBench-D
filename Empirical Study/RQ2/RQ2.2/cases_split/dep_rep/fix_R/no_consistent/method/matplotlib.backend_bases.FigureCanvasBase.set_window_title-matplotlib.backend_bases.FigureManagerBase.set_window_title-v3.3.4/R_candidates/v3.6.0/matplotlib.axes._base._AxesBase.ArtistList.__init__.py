            axes : .axes.Axes
                The Axes from which this sublist will pull the children
                Artists.
            prop_name : str
                The property name used to access this sublist from the Axes;
                used to generate deprecation warnings.
            add_name : str
                The method name used to add Artists of this sublist's type to
                the Axes; used to generate deprecation warnings.
            valid_types : list of type, optional
                A list of types that determine which children will be returned
                by this sublist. If specified, then the Artists in the sublist
                must be instances of any of these types. If unspecified, then
                any type of Artist is valid (unless limited by
                *invalid_types*.)
            invalid_types : tuple, optional
                A list of types that determine which children will *not* be
                returned by this sublist. If specified, then Artists in the
                sublist will never be an instance of these types. Otherwise, no
                types will be excluded.
