        Parameters
        ----------
        linear_width : float
            The scale parameter defining the extent
            of the quasi-linear region.
        numticks : int, default: 11
            The approximate number of major ticks that will fit
            along the entire axis
        symthresh : float, default: 0.2
            The fractional threshold beneath which data which covers
            a range that is approximately symmetric about zero
            will have ticks that are exactly symmetric.
        base : int, default: 10
            The number base used for rounding tick locations
            on a logarithmic scale. If this is less than one,
            then rounding is to the nearest integer multiple
            of powers of ten.
        subs : tuple, default: None
            Multiples of the number base, typically used
            for the minor ticks, e.g. (2, 5) when base=10.
