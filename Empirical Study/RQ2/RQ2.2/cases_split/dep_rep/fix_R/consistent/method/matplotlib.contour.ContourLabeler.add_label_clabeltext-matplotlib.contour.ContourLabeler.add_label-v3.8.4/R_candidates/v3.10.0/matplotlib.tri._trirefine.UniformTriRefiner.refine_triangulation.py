    def refine_triangulation(self, return_tri_index=False, subdiv=3):
        """
        Compute a uniformly refined triangulation *refi_triangulation* of
        the encapsulated :attr:`triangulation`.

        This function refines the encapsulated triangulation by splitting each
        father triangle into 4 child sub-triangles built on the edges midside
        nodes, recursing *subdiv* times.  In the end, each triangle is hence
        divided into ``4**subdiv`` child triangles.

        Parameters
        ----------
        return_tri_index : bool, default: False
            Whether an index table indicating the father triangle index of each
            point is returned.
        subdiv : int, default: 3
            Recursion level for the subdivision.
            Each triangle is divided into ``4**subdiv`` child triangles;
            hence, the default results in 64 refined subtriangles for each
            triangle of the initial triangulation.

        Returns
        -------
        refi_triangulation : `~matplotlib.tri.Triangulation`
            The refined triangulation.
        found_index : int array
            Index of the initial triangulation containing triangle, for each
            point of *refi_triangulation*.
            Returned only if *return_tri_index* is set to True.
