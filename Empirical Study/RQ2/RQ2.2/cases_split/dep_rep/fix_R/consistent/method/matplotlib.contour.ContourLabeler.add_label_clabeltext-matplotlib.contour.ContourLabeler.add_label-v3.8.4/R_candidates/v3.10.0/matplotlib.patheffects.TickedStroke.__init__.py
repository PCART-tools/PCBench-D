        Parameters
        ----------
        offset : (float, float), default: (0, 0)
            The (x, y) offset to apply to the path, in points.
        spacing : float, default: 10.0
            The spacing between ticks in points.
        angle : float, default: 45.0
            The angle between the path and the tick in degrees.  The angle
            is measured as if you were an ant walking along the curve, with
            zero degrees pointing directly ahead, 90 to your left, -90
            to your right, and 180 behind you. To change side of the ticks,
            change sign of the angle.
        length : float, default: 1.414
            The length of the tick relative to spacing.
            Recommended length = 1.414 (sqrt(2)) when angle=45, length=1.0
            when angle=90 and length=2.0 when angle=60.
        **kwargs
            Extra keywords are stored and passed through to
            :meth:`AbstractPathEffect._update_gc`.
