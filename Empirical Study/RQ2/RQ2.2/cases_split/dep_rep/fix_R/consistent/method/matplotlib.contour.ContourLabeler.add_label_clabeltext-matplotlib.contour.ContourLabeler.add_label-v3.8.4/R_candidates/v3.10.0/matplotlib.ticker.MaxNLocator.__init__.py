        Parameters
        ----------
        nbins : int or 'auto', default: 10
            Maximum number of intervals; one less than max number of
            ticks.  If the string 'auto', the number of bins will be
            automatically determined based on the length of the axis.

        steps : array-like, optional
            Sequence of acceptable tick multiples, starting with 1 and
            ending with 10. For example, if ``steps=[1, 2, 4, 5, 10]``,
            ``20, 40, 60`` or ``0.4, 0.6, 0.8`` would be possible
            sets of ticks because they are multiples of 2.
            ``30, 60, 90`` would not be generated because 3 does not
            appear in this example list of steps.

        integer : bool, default: False
            If True, ticks will take only integer values, provided at least
            *min_n_ticks* integers are found within the view limits.

        symmetric : bool, default: False
            If True, autoscaling will result in a range symmetric about zero.

        prune : {'lower', 'upper', 'both', None}, default: None
            Remove the 'lower' tick, the 'upper' tick, or ticks on 'both' sides
            *if they fall exactly on an axis' edge* (this typically occurs when
            :rc:`axes.autolimit_mode` is 'round_numbers').  Removing such ticks
            is mostly useful for stacked or ganged plots, where the upper tick
            of an Axes overlaps with the lower tick of the axes above it.

        min_n_ticks : int, default: 2
            Relax *nbins* and *integer* constraints if necessary to obtain
            this minimum number of ticks.
