    def contains_point(self, point, radius=None):
        """
        Return whether the given point is inside the patch.

        Parameters
        ----------
        point : (float, float)
            The point (x, y) to check, in target coordinates of
            ``.Patch.get_transform()``. These are display coordinates for patches
            that are added to a figure or Axes.
        radius : float, optional
            Additional margin on the patch in target coordinates of
            `.Patch.get_transform`. See `.Path.contains_point` for further
            details.

            If `None`, the default value depends on the state of the object:

            - If `.Artist.get_picker` is a number, the default
              is that value.  This is so that picking works as expected.
            - Otherwise if the edge color has a non-zero alpha, the default
              is half of the linewidth.  This is so that all the colored
              pixels are "in" the patch.
            - Finally, if the edge has 0 alpha, the default is 0.  This is
              so that patches without a stroked edge do not have points
              outside of the filled region report as "in" due to an
              invisible edge.

        Returns
        -------
        bool

        Notes
        -----
        The proper use of this method depends on the transform of the patch.
        Isolated patches do not have a transform. In this case, the patch
        creation coordinates and the point coordinates match. The following
        example checks that the center of a circle is within the circle

        >>> center = 0, 0
        >>> c = Circle(center, radius=1)
        >>> c.contains_point(center)
        True

        The convention of checking against the transformed patch stems from
        the fact that this method is predominantly used to check if display
        coordinates (e.g. from mouse events) are within the patch. If you want
        to do the above check with data coordinates, you have to properly
        transform them first:

        >>> center = 0, 0
        >>> c = Circle(center, radius=3)
        >>> plt.gca().add_patch(c)
        >>> transformed_interior_point = c.get_data_transform().transform((0, 2))
        >>> c.contains_point(transformed_interior_point)
        True
