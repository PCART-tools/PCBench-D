        """
        ``x`` and ``y`` sticky edge lists for autoscaling.

        When performing autoscaling, if a data limit coincides with a value in
        the corresponding sticky_edges list, then no margin will be added--the
        view limit "sticks" to the edge. A typical use case is histograms,
        where one usually expects no margin on the bottom edge (0) of the
        histogram.

        Moreover, margin expansion "bumps" against sticky edges and cannot
        cross them.  For example, if the upper data limit is 1.0, the upper
        view limit computed by simple margin application is 1.2, but there is a
        sticky edge at 1.1, then the actual upper view limit will be 1.1.

        This attribute cannot be assigned to; however, the ``x`` and ``y``
        lists can be modified in place as needed.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> artist.sticky_edges.x[:] = (xmin, xmax)
        >>> artist.sticky_edges.y[:] = (ymin, ymax)
