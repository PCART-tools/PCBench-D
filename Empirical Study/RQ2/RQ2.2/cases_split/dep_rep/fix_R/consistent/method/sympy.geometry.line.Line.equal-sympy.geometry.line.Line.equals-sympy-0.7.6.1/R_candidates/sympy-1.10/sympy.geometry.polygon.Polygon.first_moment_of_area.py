    def first_moment_of_area(self, point=None):
        """
        Returns the first moment of area of a two-dimensional polygon with
        respect to a certain point of interest.

        First moment of area is a measure of the distribution of the area
        of a polygon in relation to an axis. The first moment of area of
        the entire polygon about its own centroid is always zero. Therefore,
        here it is calculated for an area, above or below a certain point
        of interest, that makes up a smaller portion of the polygon. This
        area is bounded by the point of interest and the extreme end
        (top or bottom) of the polygon. The first moment for this area is
        is then determined about the centroidal axis of the initial polygon.

        Parameters
        ==========

        point: Point, two-tuple of sympifyable objects, or None (default=None)
            point is the point above or below which the area of interest lies
            If ``point=None`` then the centroid acts as the point of interest.

        Returns
        =======

        Q_x, Q_y: number or SymPy expressions
            Q_x is the first moment of area about the x-axis
            Q_y is the first moment of area about the y-axis
            A negative sign indicates that the section modulus is
            determined for a section below (or left of) the centroidal axis
