    def angle_between(l1, l2):
        """Return the non-reflex angle formed by rays emanating from
        the origin with directions the same as the direction vectors
        of the linear entities.

        Parameters
        ==========

        l1 : LinearEntity
        l2 : LinearEntity

        Returns
        =======

        angle : angle in radians

        Notes
        =====

        From the dot product of vectors v1 and v2 it is known that:

            ``dot(v1, v2) = |v1|*|v2|*cos(A)``

        where A is the angle formed between the two vectors. We can
        get the directional vectors of the two lines and readily
        find the angle between the two using the above formula.

        >>> from sympy import Line
        >>> e = Line((0, 0), (1, 0))
        >>> ne = Line((0, 0), (1, 1))
        >>> sw = Line((1, 1), (0, 0))
        >>> ne.angle_between(e)
        pi/4
        >>> sw.angle_between(e)
        3*pi/4

        To obtain the non-obtuse angle at the intersection of lines, use
        the ``smallest_angle_between`` method:

        >>> sw.smallest_angle_between(e)
        pi/4

        >>> from sympy import Point3D, Line3D
        >>> p1, p2, p3 = Point3D(0, 0, 0), Point3D(1, 1, 1), Point3D(-1, 2, 0)
        >>> l1, l2 = Line3D(p1, p2), Line3D(p2, p3)
        >>> l1.angle_between(l2)
        acos(-sqrt(2)/3)
        >>> l1.smallest_angle_between(l2)
        acos(sqrt(2)/3)
