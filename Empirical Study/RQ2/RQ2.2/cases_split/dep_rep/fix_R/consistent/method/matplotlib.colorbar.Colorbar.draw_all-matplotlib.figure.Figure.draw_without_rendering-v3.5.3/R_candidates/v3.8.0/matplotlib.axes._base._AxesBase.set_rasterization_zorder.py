        Set the zorder threshold for rasterization for vector graphics output.

        All artists with a zorder below the given value will be rasterized if
        they support rasterization.

        ----------
        z : float or None
            The zorder below which artists are rasterized.
            If ``None`` rasterization based on zorder is deactivated.
