        [*Discouraged*] Set tick labels.

        .. admonition:: Discouraged

            The use of this method is discouraged, because of the dependency
            on tick positions. In most cases, you'll want to use
            ``set_ticks(positions, labels=labels)`` instead.

            If you are using this method, you should always fix the tick
            positions before, e.g. by using `.Colorbar.set_ticks` or by
            explicitly setting a `~.ticker.FixedLocator` on the long axis
            of the colorbar. Otherwise, ticks are free to move and the
            labels may end up in unexpected positions.

        Parameters
        ----------
        ticklabels : sequence of str or of `.Text`
            Texts for labeling each tick location in the sequence set by
            `.Colorbar.set_ticks`; the number of labels must match the number
            of locations.

        update_ticks : bool, default: True
            This keyword argument is ignored and will be removed.
            Deprecated

         minor : bool
            If True, set minor ticks instead of major ticks.

        **kwargs
            `.Text` properties for the labels.
