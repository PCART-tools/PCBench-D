    def hillshade(self, elevation, vert_exag=1, dx=1, dy=1, fraction=1.):
        """
        Calculate the illumination intensity for a surface using the defined
        azimuth and elevation for the light source.

        This computes the normal vectors for the surface, and then passes them
        on to `shade_normals`

        Parameters
        ----------
        elevation : 2D array-like
            The height values used to generate an illumination map
        vert_exag : number, optional
            The amount to exaggerate the elevation values by when calculating
            illumination. This can be used either to correct for differences in
            units between the x-y coordinate system and the elevation
            coordinate system (e.g. decimal degrees vs. meters) or to
            exaggerate or de-emphasize topographic effects.
        dx : number, optional
            The x-spacing (columns) of the input *elevation* grid.
        dy : number, optional
            The y-spacing (rows) of the input *elevation* grid.
        fraction : number, optional
            Increases or decreases the contrast of the hillshade.  Values
            greater than one will cause intermediate values to move closer to
            full illumination or shadow (and clipping any values that move
            beyond 0 or 1). Note that this is not visually or mathematically
            the same as vertical exaggeration.

        Returns
        -------
        `~numpy.ndarray`
            A 2D array of illumination values between 0-1, where 0 is
            completely in shadow and 1 is completely illuminated.

        # Because most image and raster GIS data has the first row in the array
        # as the "top" of the image, dy is implicitly negative.  This is
        # consistent to what `imshow` assumes, as well.
        dy = -dy

        # compute the normal vectors from the partial derivatives
        e_dy, e_dx = np.gradient(vert_exag * elevation, dy, dx)
