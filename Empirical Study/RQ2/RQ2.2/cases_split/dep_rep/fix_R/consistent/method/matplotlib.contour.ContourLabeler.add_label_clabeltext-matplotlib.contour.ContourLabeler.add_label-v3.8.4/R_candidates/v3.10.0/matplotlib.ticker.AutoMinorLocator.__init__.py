            The number of subdivisions of the interval between major ticks;
            e.g., n=2 will place a single minor tick midway between major ticks.

            If *n* is 'auto', it will be set to 4 or 5: if the distance
            between the major ticks equals 1, 2.5, 5 or 10 it can be perfectly
            divided in 5 equidistant sub-intervals with a length multiple of
            0.05; otherwise, it is divided in 4 sub-intervals.
