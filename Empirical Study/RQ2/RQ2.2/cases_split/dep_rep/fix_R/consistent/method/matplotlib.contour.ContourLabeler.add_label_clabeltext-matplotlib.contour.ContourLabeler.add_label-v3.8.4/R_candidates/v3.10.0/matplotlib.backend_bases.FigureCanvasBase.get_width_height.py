    def get_width_height(self, *, physical=False):
        """
        Return the figure width and height in integral points or pixels.

        When the figure is used on High DPI screens (and the backend supports
        it), the truncation to integers occurs after scaling by the device
        pixel ratio.

        Parameters
        ----------
        physical : bool, default: False
            Whether to return true physical pixels or logical pixels. Physical
            pixels may be used by backends that support HiDPI, but still
            configure the canvas using its actual size.

        Returns
        -------
        width, height : int
            The size of the figure, in points or pixels, depending on the
            backend.
