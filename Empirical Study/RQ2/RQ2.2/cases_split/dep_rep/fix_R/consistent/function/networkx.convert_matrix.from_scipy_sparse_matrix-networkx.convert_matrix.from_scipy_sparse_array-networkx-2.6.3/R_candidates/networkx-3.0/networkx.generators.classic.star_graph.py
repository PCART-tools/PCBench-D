    """Return the star graph

    The star graph consists of one center node connected to n outer nodes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int or iterable
        If an integer, node labels are 0 to n with center 0.
        If an iterable of nodes, the center is the first.
        Warning: n is not checked for duplicates and if present the
        resulting graph may not be as desired. Make sure you have no duplicates.
    create_using : NetworkX graph constructor, optional (default=nx.Graph)
       Graph type to create. If graph instance, then cleared before populated.

    Notes
    -----
    The graph has n+1 nodes for integer n.
    So star_graph(3) is the same as star_graph(range(4)).
