  """Scatter-update operator.

  Wraps `XLA's Scatter operator
  <https://www.tensorflow.org/xla/operation_semantics#scatter>`_, where updates
  replace values from `operand`.

  If multiple updates are performed to the same index of operand, they may be
  applied in any order.

  The semantics of scatter are complicated, and its API might change in the
  future. For most use cases, you should prefer the
  :attr:`jax.numpy.ndarray.at` property on JAX arrays which uses
  the familiar NumPy indexing syntax.

  Args:
    operand: an array to which the scatter should be applied
    scatter_indices: an array that gives the indices in `operand` to which each
      update in `updates` should be applied.
    updates: the updates that should be scattered onto `operand`.
    dimension_numbers: a `lax.ScatterDimensionNumbers` object that describes
      how dimensions of `operand`, `start_indices`, `updates` and the output
      relate.
    indices_are_sorted: whether `scatter_indices` is known to be sorted. If
      true, may improve performance on some backends.
    unique_indices: whether the indices to be updated in ``operand`` are
      guaranteed to not overlap with each other. If true, may improve performance on
      some backends.
    mode: how to handle indices that are out of bounds: when set to 'clip',
      indices are clamped so that the slice is within bounds, and when
      set to 'fill' or 'drop' out-of-bounds updates are dropped. The behavior
      for out-of-bounds indices when set to 'promise_in_bounds' is
      implementation-defined.

  Returns:
    An array containing the sum of `operand` and the scattered updates.
