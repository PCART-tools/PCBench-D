def is_strongly_connected(G):
    """Test directed graph for strong connectivity.

    A directed graph is strongly connected if and only if every vertex in
    the graph is reachable from every other vertex.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX Graph
       A directed graph.

    Returns
    -------
    connected : bool
      True if the graph is strongly connected, False otherwise.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.DiGraph([(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (2, 4), (4, 2)])
    >>> nx.is_strongly_connected(G)
    True
    >>> G.remove_edge(2, 3)
    >>> nx.is_strongly_connected(G)
    False

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXNotImplemented
        If G is undirected.
