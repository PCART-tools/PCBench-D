def directed_combinatorial_laplacian_matrix(
    G, nodelist=None, weight="weight", walk_type=None, alpha=0.95
):
    r"""Return the directed combinatorial Laplacian matrix of G.

    The graph directed combinatorial Laplacian is the matrix

    .. math::

        L = \Phi - (\Phi P + P^T \Phi) / 2

    where `P` is the transition matrix of the graph and `\Phi` a matrix
    with the Perron vector of `P` in the diagonal and zeros elsewhere [1]_.

    Depending on the value of walk_type, `P` can be the transition matrix
    induced by a random walk, a lazy random walk, or a random walk with
    teleportation (PageRank).

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : DiGraph
       A NetworkX graph

    nodelist : list, optional
       The rows and columns are ordered according to the nodes in nodelist.
       If nodelist is None, then the ordering is produced by G.nodes().

    weight : string or None, optional (default='weight')
       The edge data key used to compute each value in the matrix.
       If None, then each edge has weight 1.

    walk_type : string or None, optional (default=None)
       If None, `P` is selected depending on the properties of the
       graph. Otherwise is one of 'random', 'lazy', or 'pagerank'

    alpha : real
       (1 - alpha) is the teleportation probability used with pagerank

    Returns
    -------
    L : NumPy matrix
      Combinatorial Laplacian of G.

    Notes
    -----
    Only implemented for DiGraphs
