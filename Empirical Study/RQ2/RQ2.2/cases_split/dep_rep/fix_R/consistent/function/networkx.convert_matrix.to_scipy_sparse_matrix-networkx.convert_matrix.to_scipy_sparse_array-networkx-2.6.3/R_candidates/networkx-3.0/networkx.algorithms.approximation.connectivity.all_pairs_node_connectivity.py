def all_pairs_node_connectivity(G, nbunch=None, cutoff=None):
    """Compute node connectivity between all pairs of nodes.

    Pairwise or local node connectivity between two distinct and nonadjacent
    nodes is the minimum number of nodes that must be removed (minimum
    separating cutset) to disconnect them. By Menger's theorem, this is equal
    to the number of node independent paths (paths that share no nodes other
    than source and target). Which is what we compute in this function.

    This algorithm is a fast approximation that gives an strict lower
    bound on the actual number of node independent paths between two nodes [1]_.
    It works for both directed and undirected graphs.


    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    nbunch: container
        Container of nodes. If provided node connectivity will be computed
        only over pairs of nodes in nbunch.

    cutoff : integer
        Maximum node connectivity to consider. If None, the minimum degree
        of source or target is used as a cutoff in each pair of nodes.
        Default value None.

    Returns
    -------
    K : dictionary
        Dictionary, keyed by source and target, of pairwise node connectivity

    Examples
    --------
    A 3 node cycle with one extra node attached has connectivity 2 between all
    nodes in the cycle and connectivity 1 between the extra node and the rest:

    >>> G = nx.cycle_graph(3)
    >>> G.add_edge(2, 3)
    >>> import pprint  # for nice dictionary formatting
    >>> pprint.pprint(nx.all_pairs_node_connectivity(G))
    {0: {1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 1},
     1: {0: 2, 2: 2, 3: 1},
     2: {0: 2, 1: 2, 3: 1},
     3: {0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 1}}
