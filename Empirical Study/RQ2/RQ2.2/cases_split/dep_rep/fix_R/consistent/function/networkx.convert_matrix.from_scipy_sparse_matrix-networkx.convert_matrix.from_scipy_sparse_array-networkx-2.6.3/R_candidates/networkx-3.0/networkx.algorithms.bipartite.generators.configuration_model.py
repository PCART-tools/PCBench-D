def configuration_model(aseq, bseq, create_using=None, seed=None):
    """Returns a random bipartite graph from two given degree sequences.

    Parameters
    ----------
    aseq : list
       Degree sequence for node set A.
    bseq : list
       Degree sequence for node set B.
    create_using : NetworkX graph instance, optional
       Return graph of this type.
    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
        Indicator of random number generation state.
        See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.

    The graph is composed of two partitions. Set A has nodes 0 to
    (len(aseq) - 1) and set B has nodes len(aseq) to (len(bseq) - 1).
    Nodes from set A are connected to nodes in set B by choosing
    randomly from the possible free stubs, one in A and one in B.

    Notes
    -----
    The sum of the two sequences must be equal: sum(aseq)=sum(bseq)
    If no graph type is specified use MultiGraph with parallel edges.
    If you want a graph with no parallel edges use create_using=Graph()
    but then the resulting degree sequences might not be exact.

    The nodes are assigned the attribute 'bipartite' with the value 0 or 1
    to indicate which bipartite set the node belongs to.

    This function is not imported in the main namespace.
