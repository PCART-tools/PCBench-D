def _charpoly(M, x='lambda', simplify=_simplify):
    """Computes characteristic polynomial det(x*I - M) where I is
    the identity matrix.

    A PurePoly is returned, so using different variables for ``x`` does
    not affect the comparison or the polynomials:

    Parameters
    ==========

    x : string, optional
        Name for the "lambda" variable, defaults to "lambda".

    simplify : function, optional
        Simplification function to use on the characteristic polynomial
        calculated. Defaults to ``simplify``.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import Matrix
    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y
    >>> M = Matrix([[1, 3], [2, 0]])
    >>> M.charpoly()
    PurePoly(lambda**2 - lambda - 6, lambda, domain='ZZ')
    >>> M.charpoly(x) == M.charpoly(y)
    True
    >>> M.charpoly(x) == M.charpoly(y)
    True

    Specifying ``x`` is optional; a symbol named ``lambda`` is used by
    default (which looks good when pretty-printed in unicode):

    >>> M.charpoly().as_expr()
    lambda**2 - lambda - 6

    And if ``x`` clashes with an existing symbol, underscores will
    be prepended to the name to make it unique:

    >>> M = Matrix([[1, 2], [x, 0]])
    >>> M.charpoly(x).as_expr()
    _x**2 - _x - 2*x

    Whether you pass a symbol or not, the generator can be obtained
    with the gen attribute since it may not be the same as the symbol
    that was passed:

    >>> M.charpoly(x).gen
    _x
    >>> M.charpoly(x).gen == x
    False

    Notes
    =====

    The Samuelson-Berkowitz algorithm is used to compute
    the characteristic polynomial efficiently and without any
    division operations.  Thus the characteristic polynomial over any
    commutative ring without zero divisors can be computed.

    If the determinant det(x*I - M) can be found out easily as
    in the case of an upper or a lower triangular matrix, then
    instead of Samuelson-Berkowitz algorithm, eigenvalues are computed
    and the characteristic polynomial with their help.
