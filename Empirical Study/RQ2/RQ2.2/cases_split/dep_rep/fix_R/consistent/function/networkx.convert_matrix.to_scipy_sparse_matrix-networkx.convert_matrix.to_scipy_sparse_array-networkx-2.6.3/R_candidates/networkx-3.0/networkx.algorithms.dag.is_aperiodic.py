def is_aperiodic(G):
    """Returns True if `G` is aperiodic.

    A directed graph is aperiodic if there is no integer k > 1 that
    divides the length of every cycle in the graph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX DiGraph
        A directed graph

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        True if the graph is aperiodic False otherwise

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        If `G` is not directed

    Examples
    --------
    A graph consisting of one cycle, the length of which is 2. Therefore ``k = 2``
    divides the length of every cycle in the graph and thus the graph
    is *not aperiodic*::

        >>> DG = nx.DiGraph([(1, 2), (2, 1)])
        >>> nx.is_aperiodic(DG)
        False

    A graph consisting of two cycles: one of length 2 and the other of length 3.
    The cycle lengths are coprime, so there is no single value of k where ``k > 1``
    that divides each cycle length and therefore the graph is *aperiodic*::

        >>> DG = nx.DiGraph([(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (1, 4), (4, 1)])
        >>> nx.is_aperiodic(DG)
        True

    A graph consisting of two cycles: one of length 2 and the other of length 4.
    The lengths of the cycles share a common factor ``k = 2``, and therefore
    the graph is *not aperiodic*::

        >>> DG = nx.DiGraph([(1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 3)])
        >>> nx.is_aperiodic(DG)
        False

    An acyclic graph, therefore the graph is *not aperiodic*::

        >>> DG = nx.DiGraph([(1, 2), (2, 3)])
        >>> nx.is_aperiodic(DG)
        False

    Notes
    -----
    This uses the method outlined in [1]_, which runs in $O(m)$ time
    given $m$ edges in `G`. Note that a graph is not aperiodic if it is
    acyclic as every integer trivial divides length 0 cycles.
