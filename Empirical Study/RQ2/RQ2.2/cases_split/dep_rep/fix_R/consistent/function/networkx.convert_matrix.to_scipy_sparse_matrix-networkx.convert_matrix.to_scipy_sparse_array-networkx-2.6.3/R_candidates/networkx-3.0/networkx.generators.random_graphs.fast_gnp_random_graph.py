def fast_gnp_random_graph(n, p, seed=None, directed=False):
    """Returns a $G_{n,p}$ random graph, also known as an Erdős-Rényi graph or
    a binomial graph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
        The number of nodes.
    p : float
        Probability for edge creation.
    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
        Indicator of random number generation state.
        See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.
    directed : bool, optional (default=False)
        If True, this function returns a directed graph.

    Notes
    -----
    The $G_{n,p}$ graph algorithm chooses each of the $[n (n - 1)] / 2$
    (undirected) or $n (n - 1)$ (directed) possible edges with probability $p$.

    This algorithm [1]_ runs in $O(n + m)$ time, where `m` is the expected number of
    edges, which equals $p n (n - 1) / 2$. This should be faster than
    :func:`gnp_random_graph` when $p$ is small and the expected number of edges
    is small (that is, the graph is sparse).
