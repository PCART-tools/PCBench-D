def d_separated(G, x, y, z):
    """
    Return whether node sets ``x`` and ``y`` are d-separated by ``z``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
        A NetworkX DAG.

    x : set
        First set of nodes in ``G``.

    y : set
        Second set of nodes in ``G``.

    z : set
        Set of conditioning nodes in ``G``. Can be empty set.

    Returns
    -------
    b : bool
        A boolean that is true if ``x`` is d-separated from ``y`` given ``z`` in ``G``.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        The *d-separation* test is commonly used with directed
        graphical models which are acyclic.  Accordingly, the algorithm
        raises a :exc:`NetworkXError` if the input graph is not a DAG.

    NodeNotFound
        If any of the input nodes are not found in the graph,
        a :exc:`NodeNotFound` exception is raised.

    Notes
    -----
    A d-separating set in a DAG is a set of nodes that
    blocks all paths between the two sets. Nodes in `z`
    block a path if they are part of the path and are not a collider,
    or a descendant of a collider. A collider structure along a path
    is ``... -> c <- ...`` where ``c`` is the collider node.
