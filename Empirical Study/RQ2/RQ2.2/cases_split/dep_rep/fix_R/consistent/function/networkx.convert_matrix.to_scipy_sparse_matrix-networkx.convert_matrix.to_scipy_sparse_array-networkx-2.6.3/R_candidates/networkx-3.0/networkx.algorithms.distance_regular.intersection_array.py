def intersection_array(G):
    """Returns the intersection array of a distance-regular graph.

    Given a distance-regular graph G with integers b_i, c_i,i = 0,....,d
    such that for any 2 vertices x,y in G at a distance i=d(x,y), there
    are exactly c_i neighbors of y at a distance of i-1 from x and b_i
    neighbors of y at a distance of i+1 from x.

    A distance regular graph's intersection array is given by,
    [b_0,b_1,.....b_{d-1};c_1,c_2,.....c_d]

    Parameters
    ----------
    G: Networkx graph (undirected)

    Returns
    -------
    b,c: tuple of lists

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.icosahedral_graph()
    >>> nx.intersection_array(G)
    ([5, 2, 1], [1, 2, 5])
