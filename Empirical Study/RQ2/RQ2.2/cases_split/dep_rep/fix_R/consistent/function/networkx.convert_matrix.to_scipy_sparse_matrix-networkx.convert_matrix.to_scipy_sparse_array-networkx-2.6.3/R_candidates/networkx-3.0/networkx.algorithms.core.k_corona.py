def k_corona(G, k, core_number=None):
    """Returns the k-corona of G.

    The k-corona is the subgraph of nodes in the k-core which have
    exactly k neighbours in the k-core.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
       A graph or directed graph
    k : int
       The order of the corona.
    core_number : dictionary, optional
       Precomputed core numbers for the graph G.

    Returns
    -------
    G : NetworkX graph
       The k-corona subgraph

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        The k-cornoa is not defined for graphs with self loops or
        parallel edges.

    Notes
    -----
    Not implemented for graphs with parallel edges or self loops.

    For directed graphs the node degree is defined to be the
    in-degree + out-degree.

    Graph, node, and edge attributes are copied to the subgraph.
