    Return the cubic graph specified in LCF notation.

    LCF notation (LCF=Lederberg-Coxeter-Fruchte) is a compressed
    notation used in the generation of various cubic Hamiltonian
    graphs of high symmetry. See, for example, dodecahedral_graph,
    desargues_graph, heawood_graph and pappus_graph below.

    n (number of nodes)
      The starting graph is the n-cycle with nodes 0,...,n-1.
      (The null graph is returned if n < 0.)

    shift_list = [s1,s2,..,sk], a list of integer shifts mod n,

    repeats
      integer specifying the number of times that shifts in shift_list
      are successively applied to each v_current in the n-cycle
      to generate an edge between v_current and v_current+shift mod n.

    For v1 cycling through the n-cycle a total of k*repeats
    with shift cycling through shiftlist repeats times connect
    v1 with v1+shift mod n

    The utility graph $K_{3,3}$

    >>> G = nx.LCF_graph(6, [3, -3], 3)

    The Heawood graph

    >>> G = nx.LCF_graph(14, [5, -5], 7)

    See http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LCFNotation.html for a description
    and references.
