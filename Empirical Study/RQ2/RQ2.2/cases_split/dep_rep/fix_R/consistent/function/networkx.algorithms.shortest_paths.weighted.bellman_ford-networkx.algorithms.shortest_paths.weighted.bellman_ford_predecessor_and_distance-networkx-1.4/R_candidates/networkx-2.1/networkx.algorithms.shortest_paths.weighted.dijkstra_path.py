def dijkstra_path(G, source, target, weight='weight'):
    """Returns the shortest weighted path from source to target in G.

    Uses Dijkstra's Method to compute the shortest weighted path
    between two nodes in a graph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    source : node
       Starting node

    target : node
       Ending node

    weight : string or function
       If this is a string, then edge weights will be accessed via the
       edge attribute with this key (that is, the weight of the edge
       joining `u` to `v` will be ``G.edges[u, v][weight]``). If no
       such edge attribute exists, the weight of the edge is assumed to
       be one.

       If this is a function, the weight of an edge is the value
       returned by the function. The function must accept exactly three
       positional arguments: the two endpoints of an edge and the
       dictionary of edge attributes for that edge. The function must
       return a number.

    Returns
    -------
    path : list
       List of nodes in a shortest path.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXNoPath
       If no path exists between source and target.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G=nx.path_graph(5)
    >>> print(nx.dijkstra_path(G,0,4))
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

    Notes
    -----
    Edge weight attributes must be numerical.
    Distances are calculated as sums of weighted edges traversed.

    The weight function can be used to hide edges by returning None.
    So ``weight = lambda u, v, d: 1 if d['color']=="red" else None``
    will find the shortest red path.

    The weight function can be used to include node weights.

    >>> def func(u, v, d):
    ...     node_u_wt = G.nodes[u].get('node_weight', 1)
    ...     node_v_wt = G.nodes[v].get('node_weight', 1)
    ...     edge_wt = d.get('weight', 1)
    ...     return node_u_wt/2 + node_v_wt/2 + edge_wt

    In this example we take the average of start and end node
    weights of an edge and add it to the weight of the edge.
