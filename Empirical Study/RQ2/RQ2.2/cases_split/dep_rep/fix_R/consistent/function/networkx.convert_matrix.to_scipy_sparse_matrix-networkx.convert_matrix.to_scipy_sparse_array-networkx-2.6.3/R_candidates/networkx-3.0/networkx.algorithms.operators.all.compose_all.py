def compose_all(graphs):
    """Returns the composition of all graphs.

    Composition is the simple union of the node sets and edge sets.
    The node sets of the supplied graphs need not be disjoint.

    Parameters
    ----------
    graphs : iterable
       Iterable of NetworkX graphs

    Returns
    -------
    C : A graph with the same type as the first graph in list

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
       If `graphs` is an empty list.

    Notes
    -----
    It is recommended that the supplied graphs be either all directed or all
    undirected.

    Graph, edge, and node attributes are propagated to the union graph.
    If a graph attribute is present in multiple graphs, then the value
    from the last graph in the list with that attribute is used.
