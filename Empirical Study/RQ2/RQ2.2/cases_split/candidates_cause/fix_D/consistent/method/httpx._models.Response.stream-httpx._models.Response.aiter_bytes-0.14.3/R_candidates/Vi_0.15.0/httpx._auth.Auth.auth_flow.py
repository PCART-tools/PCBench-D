        Execute the authentication flow.

        To dispatch a request, `yield` it:

        ```
        yield request
        ```

        The client will `.send()` the response back into the flow generator. You can
        access it like so:

        ```
        response = yield request
        ```

        A `return` (or reaching the end of the generator) will result in the
        client returning the last response obtained from the server.

        You can dispatch as many requests as is necessary.
