        """
        Run evaluation and returns metrics.

        The calling script will be responsible for providing a method to compute metrics, as they are
        task-dependent (pass it to the init :obj:`compute_metrics` argument).

        Args:
            eval_dataset (:class:`~tf.data.Dataset`, `optional`):
                Pass a dataset if you wish to override :obj:`self.eval_dataset`. The dataset should yield tuples of
                ``(features, labels)`` where ``features`` is a dict of input features and ``labels`` is the labels.
                If ``labels`` is a tensor, the loss is calculated by the model by calling ``model(features,
                labels=labels)``. If ``labels`` is a dict, such as when using a QuestionAnswering head model with
                multiple targets, the loss is instead calculated by calling ``model(features, **labels)``.

        Returns:
            A dictionary containing the evaluation loss and the potential metrics computed from the predictions.
