class DrawEvent(Event):
    """
    An event triggered by a draw operation on the canvas.

    In most backends, callbacks subscribed to this event will be fired after
    the rendering is complete but before the screen is updated. Any extra
    artists drawn to the canvas's renderer will be reflected without an
    explicit call to ``blit``.

    .. warning::

       Calling ``canvas.draw`` and ``canvas.blit`` in these callbacks may
       not be safe with all backends and may cause infinite recursion.

    A DrawEvent has a number of special attributes in addition to those defined
    by the parent `Event` class.

    Attributes
    ----------
    renderer : `RendererBase`
        The renderer for the draw event.
