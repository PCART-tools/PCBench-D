        """The medians of the triangle.

        A median of a triangle is a straight line through a vertex and the
        midpoint of the opposite side, and divides the triangle into two
        equal areas.

        medians : dict
            Each key is a vertex (Point) and each value is the median (Segment)
            at that point.
